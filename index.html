It is wintertime, late December: a species of "now." A narrator&#x2015;Tsypkinis on a train going to Leningrad. And it is also mid-April 1867. The newly married Dostoyevskys, Fyodor, and his wife, Anna Grigor'yevna, are on their way to Germany, for a four-year trip. This is not, like J. M. Coetzee's <em>The Master of St. Petersburg</em>, a Dostoyevsky fantasy. Neither is it a docu-novel, although its author was obsessed with getting everything "right." Nothing is invented, everything is invented. Dostoyevsky's reckless passions for gambling, for his literary vocation, for his wife, are matched by her all-forgiving love, which in turn resonates with the love of literature's disciple, Leonid Tsypkin, for Dostoyevsky. In a remarkable introductory essay (which appeared in <em>The New Yorker</em>), Susan Sontag explains why it is something of a miracle that <em>Summer in Baden-Baden</em> has survived, and celebrates the happy event of its publication in America with an account of Tsypkin's beleaguered life and the important pleasures of his marvelous novel.</p><p>Leonid Tsypkin was born in Minsk in 1926 of Russian-Jewish parents, both physicians. His last book, Summer in Baden-Baden, is the culmination of a passionate, clandestine literary vocation; a distinguished medical researcher by profession, Tsypkin never saw a page of his literary work published during his lifetime. The manuscript of Summer in Baden-Baden was smuggled out of the Soviet Union in 1981, and the novel was first published in a Russian-�migr� weekly in the United States. Tsypkin, who had been twice denied permission to leave the Soviet Union with his family, died of a heart attack in Moscow in 1982.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>English Grammar Recitation, Workbook One, Teacher Manual</h2><p>We&#39;ve been saying for years that Latin teaches English grammar better than English teaches English grammar, and now we have written a course that makes the perfect English grammar supplement for your Latin program. English Grammar Recitation: Book I is tied specifically to the grammar taught in Latina Christiana I, but it can be used successfully alongside any Latin program. Students will master (and be able to recite fluently) 31 grammar rules, 10 capitalization rules, and 15 punctuation rules. English Grammar Recitation teaches grammar through the recitation method, which works much like a catechism. Through repetition, students master about 30 grammar questions each year, for a total of about 150 grammar questions by the end of this course in five books. Students memorize the terminology and definitions of analytical grammar, much as they memorize forms in Latin. Brief exercises, including some diagramming, do accompany these grammar questions; however, the mastery of the English grammar catechism is the primary goal of this course, not its application. English Grammar Recitation also covers capitalization and punctuation through recitation. Students recite the rules and demonstrate their correct use through dictation of model sentences. It is hoped that this course can be completed in much less time than the typical English grammar course, leaving more time for composition and Latin.</p><p></p><h2>The People and the Books: 18 Classics of Jewish Literature</h2><p><p><strong>An essential exploration of a rich literary tradition from the Bible to modern times, by a &#x201c;rare literary authority&#x201d; (<em>New York Times Book Review</em>) and &#x201c;one of our keenest critics&#x201d; (<em>Washington Post</em>).</strong></p><p>Jews have long embraced their identity as &#x201c;the people of the book.&#x201d; But outside of the Bible, much of the Jewish literary tradition remains little known to nonspecialist readers. <em>The People and the Books</em> shows how central questions and themes of our history and culture are reflected in the Jewish literary canon: the nature of God, the right way to understand the Bible, the relationship of the Jews to their Promised Land, and the challenges of living as a minority in Diaspora. Adam Kirsch explores eighteen classic texts, including the biblical books of Deuteronomy and Esther, the philosophy of Maimonides, the autobiography of the medieval businesswoman Gl�ckel of Hameln, and the Zionist manifestoes of Theodor Herzl. From the Jews of Roman Egypt to the mystical devotees of Hasidism in Eastern Europe, <em>The People and the Books</em> brings the treasures of Jewish literature to life and offers new ways to think about their enduring power and influence.</p></p><p>Adam Kirsch is a poet, literary critic, and the director of the master&#x2019;s program in Jewish studies at Columbia University. He is a also columnist for Tablet and a contributor to the New York Times Book Review and The New Yorker.

A deeply serious meditation on the meaning of Jewish existence.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;[A]n entertaining and enlightening review of eighteen classic works and, at the same time, Judaism&#x2019;s most important ideas and ideals. It deserves to be on the Jewish bookshelf along with the eighteen books it opens for its reader.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Jewish Book Council</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Through profiles of eighteen indelible figures and chronicles...Adam Kirsch uncovers the unfailing excitements of a living, creative, and abiding civilization. And more: in this superbly clarifying panorama, he illumines how in the history of ideas Jews, despite so many permutations of approach, have faithfully adhered to a single sublime Idea.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Cynthia Ozick</strong><br><br>&#x201c;The people of the book are often unaware of the books of their people. Kirsch opens, unfurls, and illuminates the great works of Jewish tradition and history; he is our intellectual Sherpa, guiding us sure-footedly through the heights.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Rabbi David Wolpe, author of <em>David: The Divided Heart</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Luminous...

In Everything is Normal Until Proven Otherwise, Karl Dennis, the former director of the Chicago-area agency Kaleidoscope, offers stories from his expereinces with youth and families of Kaleidoscope. Ira Lourie, a psychiatrist, offers commentary on these stories, and how each one illustrates one of the following central tenents of the Wraparound approach. Along the way, the authors also explore how the Wraparound concept became the expression of case-level service delivery within a federal program as it attempted to change the way states and communities delivered services. Perfect for parents, policymakers, and administrators and workers in child welfare, juvenile justice, education, and mental health systems, Everything is Normal Until Proven Otherwise demonstrates the change that can occur when systems give families the chance to become equal partners in their care.Karl W. Dennis is one of the country&#39;s pioneers and leading experts in providing community-based care for the &#34;hardest-to-serve&#34; children and families through Wraparound services, theraputic foster care, pediatric AIDS care, independent living, and long-term intensive family preservation services. Ira S. Lourie, MD, a child psychiatrist, is a currently a partner in the Human Service Collaborative, which provides consultation, technical assistance, and training in human service policy and service system development.</p><h2>Jed Harris, the Curse of Genius</h2><p>Jed Harris, the curse of genius</p><p></p><h2>Elizabeth I</h2><p>Glitteringly detailed and engagingly written, the magisterial <b>Elizabeth I</b><i> </i>brings to vivid life the golden age of sixteenth-century England and the uniquely fascinating monarch who presided over it. A woman of intellect and presence, Elizabeth was the object of extravagant adoration by her contemporaries. She firmly believed in the divine providence of her sovereignty and exercised supreme authority over the intrigue-laden Tudor court and Elizabethan England at large. Brilliant, mercurial, seductive, and maddening, an inspiration to artists and adventurers and the subject of vicious speculation over her choice not to marry, Elizabeth became the most powerful ruler of her time.

With drastically opposing views between front-runners William Gibbs McAdoo of California and Governor Al Smith of New York, and the &#34;favorite sons&#34;-candidates running without national support-rigid division amongst the party led to the need for a 103rd ballot. Robert Keith Murray expertly captures the upheaval of the convention and the detrimental impact it had on the party long after a candidate had been officially selected. This riveting narrative and exceptional analysis provides a captivating look on one of the most controversial presidential conventions in American history, one that will highly resonate with readers given the state of political dissonance today.</p><p></p><h2>The Love of Impermanent Things: A Threshold Ecology (The World As Home)</h2><p>At midlife, Mary Rose O&#39;Reilley reflects on her past and her hard-won sense of self. She is determined, now, not to sacrifice or waste her self. She has struggled for years along the paths set by her suburban childhood, her Catholic upbringing, her failed marriage, and the mute duties of daughterhood. Now, she is trying to see the world through the eyes of the deer that stop outside her window and look in at her. As a wildlife rehabilitator, she feels a closer connection to the natural world as experienced by animals. As an apprentice potter, she sees in a Japanese tea bowl the ultimate balance of action and contemplation. As a Quaker, she can both sit still and sing. And as a writer, O&#39;Reilley can speak clearly to readers at midlife who are expected to know it all, but don&#39;t.</p><p>At the outset of this quiet, quirky book, O'Reilley (<i>The Barn at the End of the World</i>) declares that she has written neither a memoir nor a collection of essays: rather, she has collected ephemera. In vignettes that recall Barbara Holland's work, O'Reilley discusses the meaning of vocation&#x2014;her job as a college English professor, she says, would not begin to capture her passion for pottery or her call to the ministry of spiritual direction. Her mother, recently dead, casts a long shadow; some of O'Reilley's strongest prose is about grief. She also pays good attention to nature and animals: dogs, goldfinches, elk and deer meander through her reflections. And this is a deeply spiritual book. O'Reilley equivocates about her belief in God, but she wakes up every morning praying and practices walking meditation. She lambastes the kind of Christians who have tamed and domesticated Jesus. The genre of occasional prose invites annoying, if forgivable, repetition&#x2014;too many uses of the same Sufi phrase "The soul flies in circles," for instance. A Catholic turned Quaker, O'Reilley rebels against tidy religious language. "I want every spiritual word to be new, minted that second. Or else I want silence." Her language is not grandly new every second, but it certainly is lovely. <i>(May 25)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

With rival warships and explorers from England and France days behind, the 27-member U.S. Dari�n Exploring Expedition landed on the Atlantic shore at Caledonia Bay in eastern Panama to begin their mad dash up the coast-hugging mountains of the Dari�n wilderness. The whole world watched as this party attempted to be the first to traverse the 40-mile isthmus, the narrowest spot between the Atlantic and Pacific in all the Americas. <br><br>Later, government investigators would say they were doomed before they started. Amid the speculative fever for an Atlantic and Pacific ship canal, the terrain to be crossed had been grossly misrepresented and fictitiously mapped. By January 27, 1854, the Americans had served out their last provisions and were severely footsore but believed the river they had arrived at was an artery to the Pacific, their destination. Leading them was the charismatic commander Isaac Strain, an adventuring 33-year-old U.S. Navy lieutenant. The party could have turned back except, said Strain, they were to a man &#x201c;revolted at the idea&#x201d; of failing at a task they seemed destined to accomplish. Like the first men to try to scale Everest or reach the North Pole, they felt the eyes of their countrymen upon them. <br><br>Yet Strain&#x2019;s party would wander lost in the jungle for another sixty nightmarish days, following a tortuously contorted and uncharted tropical river. Their guns rusted in the damp heat, expected settlements never materialized, and the lush terrain provided little to no sustenance. As the unending march dragged on, the party was beset by flesh-embedding parasites and a range of infectious tropical diseases they had no antidote for (or understanding of). In the desperate final days, in the throes of starvation, the survivors flirted with cannibalism and the sickest men had to be left behind so, as the journal keeper painfully recorded, the rest might have a chance to live. <br><br>The U.S. Dari�n Exploring Expedition&#x2019;s 97-day ordeal of starvation, exhaustion, and madness&#x2014;a tragedy turned &#x201c;triumph of the soul&#x201d; due to the courage and self-sacrifice of their leader and the seamen who devotedly followed him&#x2014;is one of the great untold tales of human survival and exploration. Based on the vividly detailed log entries of Strain and his junior officers, other period sources, and Balf&#x2019;s own treks in the Dari�n Gap, this is a rich and utterly compelling historical narrative that will thrill readers who enjoyed <b>In the Heart of the Sea</b>, <b>Isaac&#x2019;s Storm</b>, and other sagas of adventure at the limits of human endurance.</p><p>TODD BALF, the author of <b>The Last River</b> and a former senior editor for<i> Outside</i>, is a contributing editor to <i>Men&#x2019;s Journal</i>. He first traveled to Panama&#x2019;s Dari�n in 1991&#x2014;a memorably flawed crossing in which he and his companions traveled by foot, burro, and dugout canoe yet managed to see neither the Pacific nor the Atlantic.<b>1 / GALES of DECEMBER<br></b><br>And we Americans are the peculiar, chosen people. . . . God has predestinated, mankind expects, great things from our race; and great things we feel in our souls. The rest of the nations must soon be in our rear. We are the pioneers of the world; the advance-guard, sent on through the wilderness of untried things, to break a new path in the New World that is ours. In our youth is our strength; in our inexperience our wisdom . . . And let us always remember, that with ourselves--almost for the first time in the history of the Earth--national selfishness is unbounded philanthropy; for we cannot do a good to America but we give alms to the world.<br><br>Herman Melville, White-Jacket (1850)<br>December 19, 1853<br>39* 56' N, 75* 8' W<br>Philadelphia<br><br>The ships rounding cape henlopen at the mouth of the Delaware River were rushing home to port. A blockade of frost had fastened upon Delaware Bay and was spreading up the river's winding, 100-mile course to Philadelphia. Already two merchant ships, the bark Louisa and the brig Loretto, were bound up near the breakwater. Another few days of single-digit cold and even the port's steam tugs might not make it out. The river would be corked until March. Along the bitterly cold Southwark waterfront, where the long wood-planked wharves and the brick-walled Navy yard thronged with officers and merchantmen safely back, the talk wasn't of Christmas or the New Year but the coming ice. Few could recall it fixing so early.<br><br>At dockside the sloop-of-war Cyane's preparations drew curious onlookers. She wasn't one of the American Navy's powerful new steamships, but an old square-rigged man-of-war whose heyday was the Mexican War, almost a decade before. There wasn't a graceful line in her 132 feet of running length, critics said, and the secretary of the Navy seemed to agree; her active duty in recent years had been confined to quiet coastal cruises. Of late the vessel had gone nowhere. A year earlier, at port in Hampton Roads, Virginia, a near mutiny had erupted, and the subsequent trial had kept the ship in limbo for months. Only in recent weeks had the Cyane received the okay to return to duty and with the order a different, more restorative kind of attention. Her hull was newly coppered and her decks and hold meticulously disinfected with a purging vinegar wash.<br><br>She was crammed with personnel. In addition the standard two-hundred-man complement for a vessel her size, she carried an unusual number of supernumeraries--a party that included three additional naval officers, a trio of engineers, and two civilian volunteers, one of those a surgeon. The extra outfit was evidently getting a lift somewhere. The Cyane was said to be headed south on Home Squadron business, but where exactly, nobody knew. The hustle and bustle suggested she had little time to lose.<br><br>In fact, throughout the frigid winter day the activity intensified. The ship's carpenters banged together chicken coops and pigpens, and the boatswain's mate's silver whistle pealed insistently. A "high die" or "heave hard" command boomed from the deck officer's speaking trumpet with enough venom to awaken the dear departed souls on Chestnut Street. Man-hauled sail bundles rose up the fore, main, and mizzen masts, and late-arriving stores, livestock, and sea trunks coursed across the gangway. By the locals' rough estimate there were well over 15,000 pounds of sea biscuit and salted meat bound for the hold--sufficient provisions for a three-month cruise, maybe more. Barrels of fresh water and spirits went down the hatchways with a number of less recognizable containers. Theodolites, sextants, spyglasses, mountain barometers, and leather cases of mathematical instruments--the exotica of a precise land survey--were being salted away too.<br><br>On the morning of December 20 the Cyane made final preparations to get under way. The long-awaited steam tug, Thunderbolt, had arrived during the night to tow them through the gathering ice. At 10 a.m. the topmen went aloft and the crew hauled up anchor. They would be making sail and tracking south along the Gulf Stream in less than forty-eight hours. The ice shattering over Cyane's bow notwithstanding, a young, adventure-minded lieutenant named Isaac Strain could not remember a time when he had felt more fortunate.<br><br>The Navy Department, in response to the wishes of President Franklin Pierce, had assigned Cyane to "special service,'' a reconnaissance of a prospective Atlantic-Pacific ship canal route through the Isthmus of Darien in present-day Panama. After a series of autumn meetings with the secretary of the Navy and Pierce, Strain unexpectedly won the command, his first. His crossing party, officially known as the U.S. Darien Exploring Expedition, was to locate what until recently had not been thought to exist: a break in the mountains across the narrowest portion of the isthmus, the so-called Darien Gap.<br><br>The tropics location had the whiff of freshness in an otherwise old and costly battle to link the seas. After centuries of being battered on the endless ice of the Canadian Arctic and never finding the storied Northwest Passage, the first nations saw something a good deal brighter in the warm crease of a slender forest. Great Britain and France were simultaneously mounting a joint survey expedition of the same Darien route, with Her Majesty's Admiralty said to be sending three English vessels, including a man-of-war and an advanced survey ship, the steam-powered Scorpion. Naturally the governments pledged cooperation. Privately, it was a different matter. Like their successful race to summit Everest a hundred years later, England saw an undertaking that would define her people's greatness. President Pierce, an aggressive expansionist who viewed the country's borders expanding to Cuba and beyond, was no less determined. Isaac Strain, he would have easily seen, was his Hillary.<br><br>There are no surviving photographs of the Cyane's crew. The exploring party didn't bring a camera, a bulky contraption still in its infancy at midcentury and rarely used outside the popular city portrait studios. Instead the journey was expected to be recorded with a draftsman's faithful and exuberantly detailed line drawings.<br><br>The first of the images, a wardroom tableau, is telling. The thirty-three-year-old Strain was a small man, but he dominates the frame. He is the lone figure standing at a large table of his fellow officers. The ship's stout captain, George Hollins, appears almost a spoof of the old Navy: rotund, sedentary, dispassionate. The ship belonged to Hollins, of course; he was the permanent commander. But the coming expedition command was Strain's, and he is Hollins's dashing opposite: lean and all storm-trim--more the sinewy bowsprit than the dense mainmast. His shoulders are right-angle square. He has an aquiline nose and a full but slender brown beard that seems to wrap his jaw like planking on a well-formed bow. His head, with its boyish thatch of brown hair, is luminous, bathed in light where the others are not. His physical posture, left arm bracing the top of a chair and right tucked inside a full-length, high-collared naval coat, is intensely attentive. The portrait seems to describe a new kind of leader, one defined by movement and stirred by the remarkable ambition of the age.<br><br>An "interoceanic" ship canal was not just a gigantic task, said one statesman, "but the greatest the world has ever known." The canal's creation would defy nature in the most fundamental way imaginable--dividing the Americas in two. The rising tide of the Pacific would flow right through a man-made, 150-foot-wide channel (bringing Atlantic-bound ship traffic along with the flood; on the receding ebb tide the vessels would cross in the opposite direction, Atlantic to Pacific).<br><br>It was an audacious plan but it was a confident time--genius was everywhere. Steamships and mail packets cruised the waters of the world, and where they stopped, the newly lain railroads started. Where a river stopped, an American engineer saw another beginning. By 1850 hundreds of artificial waterways webbed the East. It was the Canal era.<br><br>Darien, the grandest canal of them all, would change the world all over again. No railway crossed the North American continent in 1853, and none would for another fifteen years. If a "gap," or low pass existed in Darien's Atlantic mountains, as it was hotly rumored to, then the tunneling work would be minimal and the seas would be joined with relative ease.

Through several revisions and updates during Pevsner's lifetime, it continued to be a seminal essay on the subject, and even after his death, it remains as stimulating as it was back in the mid-twentieth century.<br> <br> Sir Nikolaus Pevsner (1902-1983) was one of the twentieth century's most learned and stimulating writers on art and architecture. He established his reputation with Pioneers of Modern Design, though he is probably best known for his celebrated series of guides, The Buildings of England, acknowledged as one of the great achievements of twentieth-century scholarship. He was also founding editor of The Pelican History of Art, the most comprehensive and scholarly history of art ever published in English.<br> <br> A revised and updated full-color edition of the classic study of the history of European architecture<br></p><p>'A definitive and personal overview of the buildings that make European cities the glories they are, written by one of the great critics of the century.' Sir John Tusa The Guardian. <br> <br> For over sixty years Sir Nikolaus Pevsner's study of European architecture has been regarded as a seminal work which has inspired countless students of architecture. In this updated large format edition with elegant and accessible design, an extra dimension is provided through the integration of over 200 superb colour photographs and new plans. Pevsner's claim that 'the good architect requires the sculptor's and the painter's modes of vision' is fully substantiated in this glorious volume. <br> <br> Pevsner believed that the history of architecture was primarily a history of man shaping space. With this as his starting point, he reviewed the most beautiful and dramatic structures that represent the styles and cultures of Europe from the fourth century onwards. His grand tour of Romanesque basilicas, Gothic cathedrals, Renaissance villas and Baroque churches, eloquently defines 'the changing spirits of the changing ages'. In later chapters he considers the revival of medieval forms in the age of Romanticism and the Arts and Crafts Movement through to the radical and unsparing geometry of twentieth-century Modernism. His survey concluded in the post-war years and the start of the redefinition of many devastated cityscapes and in a new preface and an illuminating postscript the architect and academic Michael Forsyth brings the review right up to the present day. In a consideration of recent buildings in Europe by modern masters such as James Stirling, Norman Foster and Frank Gehry, he identifies a natural evolution of architectural achievement. <br> <br> Through such a perceptive understanding of the heritage of past civilisations, and in the delineation of the buildings that continue to be recognized as the greatest symbols of artistic endeavour, Pevsner continues to be as stimulating and relevant as ever. <br> <br> Pevsner believed that the history of architecture was primarily a history of man shaping space.

M. Homes was given up for adoption before she was born. Her biological mother was a twenty-two-year-old single woman who was having an affair with a much older married man with a family of his own. <i>The Mistress's Daughter</i> is the ruthlessly honest account of what happened when, thirty years later, her birth parents came looking for her. Homes relates how they initially made contact and what happened afterwards, and digs through the family history of both sets of her parents in a twenty-first-century electronic search for self. Daring, heartbreaking, and startlingly funny, Homes's memoir is a brave and profoundly moving consideration of identity and family.</p><p><b>A.M. Homes</b> is the author of several books of fiction. She has been awarded a Guggenheim and National Endowment for the Arts fellowships, and is a contributing editor at <i>Vanity Fair</i>.A.M. Homes always knew she was adopted. When she was 31, her biological mother initiated contact with her, the daughter she gave away. Jane Adams gives an extraordinary performance, bringing to life the almost clinical objectivity Homes employs throughout the first two-thirds of this memoir as she reassesses her identity after her biological mother turns her life upside down. The final third of the book spirals downward into rage over her father's broken promise to invite her into his family. Adams puts all that anger into her performance. After 22 minutes of asking questions without answers in a voice that becomes more and more hate-filled, Adams leaves the listener exhausted and full of pity for all the players in this sad story.

George Sue�o and Ernie Bascom, sergeants in the US 8th Army CID, are called in by the formidable KNP detective Gil Kwon-up to investigate. George and Ernie's job is to liaise with Korean law enforcement on matters that may involve or implicate 8th Army American servicemen. <br><br>But as they learn about the case, George and Ernie realize this isn't their jurisdiction&#x2014;the nearby village of Sonyu-ri is occupied by the US Army's 2nd Infantry Division, a disciplined and often brutal force that won't stand for outside officers questioning its men. All that George and Ernie are able to glean before being kicked out of town is that they are close to the truth&#x2014;and that a mysterious smuggler, known locally as "the Ville Rat," holds the key to the woman's murder.<br><br>Luckily, the pair is officially assigned another investigation in the area, which allows them to continue nosing around for answers. They are to elucidate the circumstances of a shooting incident between a young African American private and his white supervising chief. Racial tensions run high, and George and Ernie must tread carefully to solve both cases. But they aren't exactly known for going out of their way to avoid stepping on US Army toes, and this is no exception.</p><p>Martin Lim�n retired from military service after twenty years in the US Army, including ten years in Korea.

He lives near Seattle.<b>1</b><br><br>We left the Main Supply Route and turned onto the two-lane blacktop that led toward the village of Sonyu-ri. The road dropped off precipitously and we both held onto the overhead roll bar as the jeep bounced downhill. When we reached ground level, the tire chains caught and began to crunch reassuringly on freshly fallen snow. Still, even though the time was already an hour past dawn, visibility was poor. Ernie switched on the headlights.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Are you sure you&#x2019;re using the right map there, pal?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Official army map,&#x201d; I told him, slapping the folded sheet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the date on it?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I aimed the beam of my flashlight and checked. &#x201c;Twenty years ago.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Right at the end of the Korean War,&#x201d; Ernie said. &#x201c;This area north of Seoul has changed since then. Half the roads probably aren&#x2019;t even listed.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And half the villages, I thought. With two million dead out of a population of twenty million at the end of the war, the Republic of Korea was only now beginning to recover. And they were still nervous about another North Korean invasion. With 700,000 bloodthirsty Communist soldiers on the far side of the Demilitarized Zone, just a few miles from here, who could blame them? On the trip from Seoul, we&#x2019;d passed two ROK Army checkpoints and driven around a mile-long row of armor-blocking cement pilings, and rolled beneath tank traps set to explode if the northern hordes ever decided to come south again.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is George Sue�o. My partner Ernie Bascom and I are agents for the 8th United States Army Criminal Investigation Division in Seoul. The call had come in at oh-dark-thirty. Our presence was requested at a crime scene some fifteen miles north of the capital city in a village known as Sonyu-ri. Said presence was requested now. Or, as 8th Army liked to say, immediately if not sooner.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We continued to roll down the snow-covered road, passing the Paju-gun County Health Clinic on our right and then a few idle three-wheeled tractors parked along the edge of a four-foothigh berm. Rows of small farmhouses sat cozy in the brisk winter breeze. Fifty yards farther along, just where the map told me they would be, a cluster of blue police sedans waited atop a rise. As we bounced up the dirt pathway, all eyes were on us, even Mr. Kill&#x2019;s.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His real name was Gil Kwon-up, chief homicide inspector for the Korean National Police, but &#x201c;Kill&#x201d; is what the American Army MPs had taken to calling him. Changing &#x201c;Gil&#x201d; to &#x201c;Kill&#x201d; made some sort of sense, at least in GI minds. Whenever they could turn a Korean name or word into something American, they did it. Ernie and I had worked with Mr. Kill before, on more than one case, and somehow we had won his grudging respect. Ernie for his ability to blend in with GIs everywhere, under any conditions, and me for my facility with the Korean language and interest in Korea&#x2019;s five-thousand-year-old culture.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ernie drove up closer to the other vehicles, turned off the engine, and set the emergency brake. We pushed open the stiff canvas doors, climbed out of the jeep, and trudged to the top of the rise.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kill wore a broad-brimmed fedora and a dapper overcoat made of thick material. He stood with his hands shoved deep into his pockets, staring at us. He was tall for a Korean but at six-footone Ernie loomed over him. I was three inches taller than Ernie, but to show respect for Mr. Kill&#x2019;s rank, I stopped lower down on the ridge. We were eye to eye. I nodded a greeting. So did Ernie. Kill pulled his right hand out of his pocket and motioned for us to follow. We did, downhill to the ice-encrusted banks of the Sonyu River.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the stray beams of a half-dozen flashlights, it was the splash of color I saw first. Bright red. Ernie saw it too. We both stopped. Mr. Kill took two steps forward and then crouched, both to get himself a better view and to give us time to absorb the scene. The rays of illumination coalesced around her, like a spotlight introducing a star. It was then I saw the stiff flesh and the raven black hair.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was beautiful. Like an ice princess.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somehow her body had been washed up against the shore and any further drift had been stopped by a foot-high shelf of crystalline white snow. She was wearing a <i>chima-jeogori</i>, a traditional Korean dress made of flowing red silk. The skirt had been tied breast-high, as was the custom, and embroidered with white cranes flapping broad wings to the sky. The short blouse was made of a sturdier material and was canary yellow and tied in the front with a long blue ribbon. Her eyes were open, staring into the opaque gray sky, and the smooth flesh of her face seemed to have been bleached pure white by death. A cold breeze blew down from the north. I shuddered. So did Ernie. So did every cop milling about the crime scene, except for Mr. Kill.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was known to be impervious to petty feelings. Heartless, some called him. But I knew that when he was on a crime scene he didn&#x2019;t have time for emotions, only thought. And the processes of his mind, coupled with his vast investigative experience, were not good news for the perpetrators of any crime scenes he was assigned to.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stared at the woman again. Who could have done such a thing? Who could have so cruelly abandoned her in this frigid, unrelenting stream?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sonyu River does not run deep. No more than three or four feet now and even less in the dry summer months. But due to the cold snap that had drifted down from Manchuria in recent weeks, it was frozen almost solid, except for the five or six inches of frigid water that rushed by beneath the ice. The river was about twenty feet wide and at its center, for a width of about two yards, it ran quickly and freely.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ernie looked upstream. &#x201c;How far did she drift?&#x201d; he asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kill nodded at the question but didn&#x2019;t answer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upriver, a basketball-sized chunk of ice broke free and swirled toward the body. It spun madly and crashed into the red skirt, lifting it lewdly up pale legs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No underwear,&#x201d; Ernie said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which was unusual. Part of the traditional female outfit during the winter was a wool tunic and long underpants and warm socks under cotton-stuffed slippers. All designed to combat the long Korean winter. None of these appurtenances were worn by the Lady of the Ice.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The silk string that was used to secure the wrapped skirt was loose, trailing limply in the slow current.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As if we were thinking the same thing, both Ernie and I turned and gazed upriver. The meandering stream ran through rice paddies and past small animal pens and near farmhouses, and although we couldn&#x2019;t see it from here, we both knew that just over the rise was an installation we were both familiar with: Camp Pelham, home of the 2nd of the 17th Field Artillery, which maybe explained why Mr. Kill had called for us. Even though he was the chief homicide investigator of the Korean National Police, under the Status of Forces Agreement signed between the US and the Republic of Korea, he had no jurisdiction on American military compounds.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A large van pulled up and a team of forensic technicians climbed out. They all wore blue smocks and a few of them toted metal briefcases. Stenciled on their backs in block hangul script was the word <i>kyongchal</i>. Police. Mr. Kill left us and gave them a quick briefing. Soon, they were plotting their grids and slipping on knee-high rubber wading boots.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another group of cops had apparently been canvassing the neighborhood and reported back to Mr. Kill. He listened to them and nodded and then barked further orders, pointing at the homes off in the distance. The men saluted and left.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked back to us. Wearily, he nodded toward the corpse. &#x201c;Your thoughts,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I let Ernie go first.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nobody but a madwoman would leave her house dressed like that, not in this weather.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kill nodded.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And the knot holding her skirt came loose,&#x201d; Ernie continued, &#x201c;probably tied in a hurry.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;Do we know the cause of death?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No,&#x201d; Mr. Kill replied, &#x201c;but did you see her neck?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all turned and studied the body. Mr. Kill switched on his flashlight. The technicians were closing in on her now, one of them examining the silk skirt.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Bruises. She was strangled,&#x201d; Ernie said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Mr. Kill replied. &#x201c;The river is much too shallow for her to have drowned.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ernie glanced toward the invisible compound upriver. &#x201c;I bet Eighth Army won&#x2019;t see it that way.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If an American GI was in any way involved, the powers that be at the 8th Imperial Army would do their best to deny it. A young woman, maybe inebriated, staggers around in the dark. She trips and falls into the frigid waters of the Sonyu River, she struggles,<br>maybe hits her head against a rock. She&#x2019;s disoriented and starts gulping down water. She passes out. Before you know it, she&#x2019;s history.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was that scenario possible? Barely. But all cops, military or otherwise, play the percentages. And with a battalion full of horny American artillerymen just a couple of hundred yards upriver, the percentages were that one of them had something to do with this. One of the technicians squatted in the stream. Wearing plastic gloves, he searched the dead woman&#x2019;s clothing. We waited expectantly. At first, he found nothing. No jewelry, no money, no laminated Korean National Identification Card, nothing that would make our lives easier. Finally, from the inner sleeve, he pulled out a piece of paper. He waded out of the water and handed it to Mr. Kill. The paper was wet but appeared to be made of cloth vellum. Thick. The type of paper used for official documents. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kill, having similarly slipped on plastic gloves, unfolded the paper.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We held our breath.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, he twisted the dripping paper toward us. It was a torn shard. Some of the ink had run but it was still legible, composed of the phonetic hangul script interspersed with Chinese characters.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What does it say?&#x201d; Ernie asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You might recognize it,&#x201d; Mr. Kill said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about a night and a meeting and something being stretched.&#x201d; He surveyed our blank faces and almost smiled. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s poetry,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have it identified.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And the calligraphy,&#x201d; I said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, another key point. It&#x2019;s clearly written with ink and a brush, not a ballpoint pen. That in itself is a lead. Very few people write this way anymore.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except for Mr. Kill himself. He was an expert calligrapher. He&#x2019;d been educated in classical Korean, which included Chinese characters, and he&#x2019;d attended university in the States, which was why he spoke English so well. And it probably explained why he so quickly recognized this snippet of writing as a fragment of a longer work of poetry.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So maybe we can leave now?&#x201d; Ernie said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kill stared at him quizzically.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ernie glanced back toward Camp Pelham. &#x201c;None of those guys is an expert calligrapher, or is likely to have anything to do with anybody who is.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;How can you be so sure?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;They&#x2019;re nothing but a bunch of know-nothing GIs. Lowlifes.&#x201d; Ernie jabbed his thumb into his chest. &#x201c;I ought to know. I&#x2019;ve been working with them all of my adult life.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You harbor such a high opinion of your fellow soldiers?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m being generous. These are guys who read comic books and watch cartoons on AFKN on Saturday mornings. Hell, anybody who can pass a fifth-grade spelling test, like my partner Sue�o here, they think he&#x2019;s a freaking <i>genius</i>.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Still,&#x201d; Kill said, looking back at the body floating in the frozen river. &#x201c;She was a beautiful woman. They are men. They would&#x2019;ve been watching her.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; Ernie said, &#x201c;but the Second D MPI isn&#x2019;t going to like it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was referring to the 2nd Infantry Division military police investigators. They controlled the three-hundred-or-so-squaremile area in which the US 2nd Infantry Division operated. Even though the 8th US Army was the higher headquarters, and theoretically in charge of all operations in Korea, the 2nd D cops wouldn&#x2019;t want us 8th Army investigators poking our noses into what they would consider to be none of our business. A jurisdictional dispute could be overcome, but it would take some high-level phone calls. And the Division would like even less the Korean National Police sniffing around one of their compounds. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We will let the evidence lead us,&#x201d; Mr. Kill said. With that, he turned and started to walk back to his blue police sedan.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ernie called after him. &#x201c;So that means we can&#x2019;t leave?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he replied without looking back. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already made some phone calls.

Working primarily in photography and sculpture, Leonard consistently confronts the realities of change, love, and loss. This book brings audiences up to date on Leonard's impressive body of work and accompanies a long-awaited retrospective exhibition. It features images and examinations from every one of Leonard's major series, including her early aerial and museum photographs, her landmark works--Strange Fruit and Analogue--and her most recent works, "In the Wake."

England became the first country to expel a Jewish minority from its borders. They were allowed to take their portable property but their houses were confiscated by the king. In a highly readable account, Robin Mundill considers the Jews of medieval England as victims of violence (notably the massacre of Shabbat haGadol when York's Jewish community perished at Clifford's Tower) and as a people apart, isolated amidst a hostile environment. The origins of the business world are considered including the fact that the medieval English Jew perfected modern business methods many centuries before its recognised time. What emerges is a picture of a lost society which had much to contribute and yet was turned away in 1290.</p></p><p>Dr Robin R Mundill is Honorary Research Fellow at the School of History at the University of St Andrews and Head of History at Glenalmond College, Perth. He is a member of the Jewish Historical Society of England. An expert on the Jews of medieval England, he has written books and articles on the subject, and contributed to radio and television documentaries for the BBC and German broadcasters.From the author of the acclaimed book on the expulsion of the Jews from England in 1290 we now have a lively account of the Jews of medieval England. From now on no one will have any excuse for not including Jews as an integral part of the history of Norman and Angevin England. (Dr Anna Sapir Abulafia, University of Cambridge)<br><br>The history of medieval English Jews was well-served by earlier scholars, but as more and more evidence has been sifted and as technical scholarship has blossomed over the last several decades, it also became clear that there was a pressing need for a comprehensive new synthesis.With Robin Mundill's eminently readable book this need is addressed head on. The arguments he offers and the insights he provides into the relations of Jews and Christians in medieval England will be the ones the next generation of scholars will have to engage if they are to make further progress on this exciting subject. Mundill's accomplishment is commendable, and his work will constitute a powerful stimulus to further research. (William Chester Jordan, Dayton-Stockton Professor of History, Princeton University.)<br><br>Robin Mundill's new book is a very welcome addition to the all-too-short shelf of books dealing with the Jews of medieval England. It reflects Mundill's enviable familiarity with the manuscript and secondary sources, which he weaves into a praiseworthy overview of his subject, and presents a readable picture of how Jews lived in a medieval Christian milieu. (Dr Zefira Entin Rok�ah, Jerusalem)<br><br>Mention in Times Higher Education.<br><br>It is a sad and sorry tale but is well worth the retelling. There is no better guide than Robin Mundill ... It is a fascinating chapter in English history and Mundill does it full justice. (<i>The American Spectator</i>)<br><br>'[A] fascinating vision of the Middle Ages ... lively and engaging.' (<i>Church Times</i>)<br><br>'Mr Mundill gives us a good survey based on a mastery of surviving records.' (<i>Contemporary Review</i>)<br><br>'The author, who is well versed in both the primary and secondary sources of his subject, writes interestingly about the Jewish population... Overall, this is a useful book.' (<i>History</i>)<br><br>'<em>The King's Jews</em> is written with verve and enthusiasm, clarity and balance. It provides an excellent starting-point for those wishing to understand not only the factual, historical details of the Jew's lives, but also the complicated, intricate relationship they had with the communities from whom they would ultimately be expelled.' (<i>History Today</i>)<br><br>From the author of the acclaimed book on the expulsion of the Jews from England in 1290 we now have a lively account of the Jews of medieval England. From now on no one will have any excuse for not including Jews as an integral part of the history of Norman and Angevin England.

You recognize his walk, the thunder of his voice.</p><p>He taunts you with bills you can't pay, people you can't please, habits you can't break, failures you can't forget, and a future you can't face. But just like David, you can face your giant, even if you aren't the strongest, the smartest, the best equipped, of the holiest.</p><p>David. You could read his story and wonder what God saw in him. His life has little to offer the unstained, straight-A saint. He fell as often as he stood, stumbled as often as he conquered. But for those who know the sound of Goliath, David gives this reminder:</p><p>Focus on giants -- you stumble; focus on God -- your giants tumble.</p><p>If you're ready to face your giants, let his story inspire you. The same God who helped him will help you.</p></p><p><p>Since entering the ministry in 1978, Max Lucado has served churches in Miami, Florida; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and San Antonio, Texas.

David crashed onto the scene in ancient Israel when he used a slingshot and one stone to fell the giant Goliath. He went on to become Israel's greatest king. Now Lucado has modern readers slaying their own giants using principles gleaned from David's life. For example, David focused on God, not giants; David's life was threatened by his nemesis King Saul, but David worshiped God; David stole the beautiful Bathsheba from her husband and then had him killed, but God forgave. Lucado goes beyond the storytelling to offer readers concrete actions to help slay their giants using the metaphor of the five stones David chose in his Goliath quest. The stones represent the past, prayer, priority, passion and persistence. Lucado's lively language ("Focus on giants&#x2014;you stumble. Focus on God&#x2014;your giants tumble.") and casual style appeal to the most reluctant readers, yet his spiritual depth will challenge and amaze. Added value comes with the study guide keyed to each chapter. Lucado has a giant winner here. <i>(Nov. 21)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I don&#x2019;t even know his real name. I mean, we&#x2019;ve been talking online for months now, so I know things that matter. He&#x2019;s smart and sweet and funny, and we&#x2019;ve both just finished our junior year. We share the same obsession&#x2014;old movies. We both like being alone.<br> <br>If these were the only things we had in common, I wouldn&#x2019;t be freaking out right now. But Alex lives in the same town as my dad, and that makes things . . . complicated.<br> <br>Because now that I&#x2019;m descending a Central California airport escalator in Alex&#x2019;s general vicinity, watching strangers drift in the opposite direction, endless possibilities duke it out inside my head. Is Alex short? Tall? Does he chew too loud or have some irritating catchphrase? Does he pick his nose in public? Has he had his arms replaced with bionic tentacles? (Note to self: not a deal breaker.)<br> <br>So, yeah. Meeting real-life Alex could be great, but it could also be one big awkward disappointment. Which is why I&#x2019;m not really sure if I want to know anything more about him.<br> <br>Look, I don&#x2019;t do confrontation well. Or ever, really. What I&#x2019;m doing now, moving across the country one week after my seventeenth birthday to live with my dad, is not an act of bravery. It&#x2019;s a masterpiece of avoidance. My name is Bailey Rydell, and I&#x2019;m a habitual evader.<br> <br>When my mom traded my dad for Nate Catlin of Catlin Law LLC&#x2014;I swear to all things holy, that&#x2019;s how he introduces himself&#x2014;I didn&#x2019;t choose to live with her instead of Dad because of all the things she promised: new clothes, a car of my own, a trip to Europe. Heady stuff, sure, but none of it mattered. (Or even happened. Just saying.) I only stayed with her because I was embarrassed for my dad, and the thought of having to deal with him while he faced his new postdump life was too much for me to handle. Not because I don&#x2019;t care about him either. Just the opposite, actually.<br> <br>But a lot changes in a year, and now that Mom and Nate are fighting constantly, it&#x2019;s time for me to exit the picture. That&#x2019;s the thing about being an evader. You have to be flexible and know when to bail before it all gets weird. Better for everyone, really. I&#x2019;m a giver.<br> <br>My plane landed half an hour ago, but I&#x2019;m taking a circuitous route to what I hope is the backside of baggage claim, where my dad is supposed to pick me up. The key to avoiding uncomfortable situations is a preemptive strike: make sure you see them first. And before you accuse me of being a coward, think again. It&#x2019;s not easy being this screwed up. It takes planning and sharp reflexes. A devious mind. My mom says I&#x2019;d make a great pickpocket, because I can disappear faster than you can say, Where&#x2019;s my wallet? The Artful Dodger, right here.<br> <br>And right there is my father. Artful Dodger, senior. Like I said, it&#x2019;s been a year since I&#x2019;ve seen him, and the dark-headed man standing under a slanted beam of early afternoon sunlight is different than I remember. In better shape, sure, but that&#x2019;s no surprise. I&#x2019;ve cheered on his new gym-crafted body every week as he showed off his arms during our Sunday-night video calls. And the darker hair wasn&#x2019;t new either; God knows I&#x2019;ve teased him about dyeing away the gray in an attempt to slice off the last few years of his forties.<br> <br>But as I stealthily scope him out while hiding behind a sunny CALIFORNIA DREAMERS! sign, I realize that the one thing I didn&#x2019;t expect was for my dad to be so . . . happy.<br> <br>Maybe this wouldn&#x2019;t be too painful, after all. Deep breath.<br> <br>A grin splits his face when I duck out of my hiding spot.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mink,&#x201d; he says, calling me by my silly adolescent nickname.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t really mind, because he&#x2019;s the only one who calls me that in real life, and everyone else in baggage claim is too busy greeting their own familial strangers to pay any attention to us. Before I can avoid it, he reels me in and hugs me so hard my ribs crack. We both tear up a little. I swallow the constriction in my throat and force myself to calm down.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jesus, Bailey.&#x201d; He looks me over shyly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re practically grown.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You can introduce me as your sister if it makes you look younger in front of your geekazoid sci-fi friends,&#x201d; I joke in an attempt to diffuse the awkwardness, poking the robot on his Forbidden Planet T-shirt.<br> <br>&#x201c;Never. You&#x2019;re my greatest achievement.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ugh. I&#x2019;m embarrassed that I&#x2019;m so easily wooed by this, and I can&#x2019;t think of a witty comeback. I end up sighing a couple of times.<br> <br>His fingers tremble as he tucks bleached platinum-blond strands of my long Lana Turner pin-curl waves behind my ear. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so glad you&#x2019;re here. You are staying, right? You didn&#x2019;t change your mind on the flight?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If you think I&#x2019;m going to willingly walk back into that MMA fight they call a marriage, you don&#x2019;t know me at all.&#x201d;<br> <br>He does a terrible job at hiding his giddy triumph, and I can&#x2019;t help but smile back. He hugs me again, but it&#x2019;s okay now. The worst part of our uncomfortable meet-and-greet is over.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s collect your stuff. Everyone on your flight has already claimed theirs, so it shouldn&#x2019;t be too hard to find,&#x201d; he says, gesturing with a knowing dart of his eyes toward the luggage carousels, one brow cocked.<br> <br>Oops. Should&#x2019;ve known. Can&#x2019;t dodge a dodger.<br> <br>Having grown up on the East Coast, I&#x2019;d never been farther west than a single school trip to Chicago, so it&#x2019;s strange to step into bright sunlight and look up at such a big, �berblue sky. It seems flatter out here without all the dense mid-Atlantic treetops blocking out the skyline&#x2014;so flat, I can see mountain foothills girding the entire Silicon Valley horizon. I&#x2019;d flown into San Jose, the nearest airport and actual big city, so we have a forty-five-minute drive to my dad&#x2019;s new house on the coast. Not a hardship, especially when I see we&#x2019;ll be cruising in a glossy blue muscle car with the sunroof wide open.<br> <br>My father is a CPA. He used to drive the most boring car in the world. California has changed that, I suppose. What else has changed?<br> <br>&#x201c;Is this your midlife-crisis car?&#x201d; I ask when he opens the trunk to stow my luggage.<br> <br>He chuckles. It totally is. &#x201c;Get in,&#x201d; he says, checking the screen on his phone. &#x201c;And please text your mother that you didn&#x2019;t die in a fiery plane crash so she&#x2019;ll stop bugging me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Aye, aye, Captain Pete.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Goofball.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Weirdo.&#x201d;<br> <br>He nudges me with his shoulder, and I nudge back, and just like that, we&#x2019;re falling back into our old routine. Thank God. His new (old) car smells like the stuff that neat freaks spray on leather, and there&#x2019;s no accounting paperwork stuffed in the floorboards, so I&#x2019;m getting the posh treatment. As he revs up the crazy-loud engine, I turn on my phone for the first time since I&#x2019;ve landed.<br> <br>Texts from Mom: four. I answer her in the most bare-bones way possible while we leave the airport parking garage. I&#x2019;m finally coming down from the shock of what I&#x2019;ve done&#x2014;holy crap, I just moved across the country. I remind myself that it&#x2019;s not a big deal. After all, I already switched schools a few months ago, thanks to Nate LLC and Mom moving us from New Jersey to Washington, DC, which basically means I didn&#x2019;t have a notable friend investment in DC to leave behind. And I haven&#x2019;t really dated anyone since my dad left, so no boyfriend investment either. But when I check the nonemergency notifications on my phone, I see a reply on the film app from Alex and get nervous all over again about being in the same town.<br> <br>@alex: Is it wrong to hate someone who used to be your best friend? Please talk me down from planning his funeral. Again.<br> <br>I send a quick reply&#x2014;<br> <br>@mink: You should just leave town and make new friends. Less blood to clean up.<br> <br>If I look past any reservations I may have, I can admit it&#x2019;s pretty thrilling to think that Alex has no idea I&#x2019;m even here. Then again, he&#x2019;s never really known exactly where I&#x2019;ve been. He thinks I still live in New Jersey, because I never bothered to change my profile online when we moved to DC.<br> <br>When Alex first asked me to come out here and see North by Northwest with him, I wasn&#x2019;t sure what to think. It&#x2019;s not exactly the kind of movie you ask a girl out to see when you&#x2019;re trying to win her heart&#x2014;not most girls, anyway. Considered one of Alfred Hitchcock&#x2019;s greatest films, it stars Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint, and it&#x2019;s a thriller about mistaken identity. It starts in New York and ends up out West, as Cary Grant is pursued to Mount Rushmore in one of the most iconic scenes in movie history. But now every time I think about seeing it, I picture myself as the seductive Eva Marie Saint and Alex as Cary Grant, and we&#x2019;re falling madly in love, despite the fact that we barely know each other. And sure, I know that&#x2019;s a fantasy, and reality could be so much weirder, which is why I have a plan: secretly track down Alex before North by Northwest plays at the summer film festival.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t say it was a good plan. Or an easy plan. But it&#x2019;s better than an awkward meet-up with someone who looks great on paper, but in real life, may crush my dreams. So I&#x2019;m doing this the Artful Dodger way&#x2014;from a safe distance, where neither of us can get hurt. I have a lot of experience with bad strangers. It&#x2019;s best this way, trust me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is that him?&#x201d; Dad asks.<br> <br>I quickly pocket my phone. &#x201c;Who?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s-his-face. Your film-buff soul mate.&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve barely told Dad anything about Alex. I mean, he knows Alex lives in this area and even jokingly dangled this fact as bait to come out here when I finally decided I couldn&#x2019;t handle living with Mom and Nate anymore.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s contemplating murder,&#x201d; I tell Dad. &#x201c;So I&#x2019;ll probably meet him in a dark alley tonight and jump into his unmarked van. That should be fine, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>An undercurrent of tension twitches between us, just for a second. He knows I&#x2019;m only teasing, that I would never take that kind of risk, not after what happened to our family four years ago. But that&#x2019;s in the past, and Dad and I are all about the future now. Nothing but sunshine and palm trees ahead.<br> <br>He snorts. &#x201c;If he&#x2019;s got a van, don&#x2019;t expect to be able to track it down.&#x201d; Crap. Does he know I&#x2019;ve entertained that idea? &#x201c;Everyone&#x2019;s got vans where we&#x2019;re headed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Creepy molester vans?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;More like hippie vans. You&#x2019;ll see. Coronado Cove is different.&#x201d;<br> <br>And he shows me why after we turn off the interstate&#x2014;sorry, the &#x201c;freeway,&#x201d; as Dad informs me they&#x2019;re called out here. Once the location of a historical California mission, Coronado Cove is now a bustling tourist town between San Francisco and Big Sur. Twenty thousand residents, and twice as many tourists. They come for three things: the redwood forest, the private nude beach, and the surfing.<br> <br>Oh, yes: I said redwood forest.<br> <br>They come for one other thing, and I&#x2019;d be seeing that up close and personal soon enough, which makes my stomach hurt to think about. So I don&#x2019;t. Not right now. Because the town is even prettier than it was in the photos Dad sent. Hilly, cypress-lined streets. Spanish-style stucco buildings with terra-cotta tile roofs. Smoky purple mountains in the distance. And then we hit Gold Avenue, a two-lane twisting road that hugs the curving coast, and I finally see it: the Pacific Ocean.<br> <br>Alex was right. East Coast beaches are trash beaches. This . . . is stunning.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s so blue,&#x201d; I say, realizing how dumb I sound but unable to think of a better description of the bright aquamarine water breaking toward the sand. I can even smell it from the car. It&#x2019;s salty and clean, and unlike the beach back home, which has that iodine, boiled-metal stench, it doesn&#x2019;t make me want to roll up the window.<br> <br>&#x201c;I told you, didn&#x2019;t I? It&#x2019;s paradise out here,&#x201d; Dad says. &#x201c;Everything is going to be better now. I promise, Mink.&#x201d;<br> <br>I turn to him and smile, wanting to believe he might be right. And then his head whips toward the windshield and we screech to a stop.<br> <br>My seat belt feels like a metal rod slapping across my chest as I jerk forward and brace my hands on the dash. Brief pain shoots through my mouth and I taste copper. The high-pitched squeal that comes out of me, I realize, is entirely too loud and dramatic; apart from my biting my own tongue, no one&#x2019;s hurt, not even the car.<br> <br>&#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; Dad asks.<br> <br>More embarrassed than anything else, I nod before turning my attention to the cause of our near wreck: two teen boys in the middle of the street. They both look like walking advertisements for coconut tanning oil&#x2014;tousled sun-lightened hair, board shorts, and lean muscles. One dark, one light. But the towheaded one is mad as hell and pounds the hood of the car with his fists.<br> <br>&#x201c;Watch where you&#x2019;re going, dickwad,&#x201d; he shouts, pointing to a colorful hand-painted wooden sign of a line of surfers marching their boards through an Abbey Road&#x2013;looking crosswalk. The top says: WELCOME TO CORONADO COVE. The bottom reads: BE KIND&#x2014;GIVE SURFERS RIGHT-OF-WAY.<br> <br>Umm, yeah, no. The sign is nowhere near official, and even if it were, there&#x2019;s no real crosswalk on the street and this white-haired shirtless dude doesn&#x2019;t have a board. But no way am I saying that, because (A) I just screamed like a 1950s housewife, and (B) I don&#x2019;t do confrontation. Especially not with a boy who looks like he&#x2019;s just inhaled a pipeful of something cooked up in a dirty trailer.<br> <br>His brown-haired buddy has the decency to be wearing a shirt while jaywalking. On top of that, he&#x2019;s ridiculously good-looking (ten points) and trying to pull his jerky friend out of the road (twenty points). And as he does, I get a quick view of a nasty, jagged line of dark-pink scars that curves from the sleeve of his weathered T-shirt down to a bright red watch on his wrist, like someone had to Frankenstein his arm back together a long time ago; maybe this isn&#x2019;t his first time dragging his friend out of the road. He looks as embarrassed as I feel, sitting here with all these cars honking behind us, and while he wrestles his friend back, he holds up a hand to my dad and says, &#x201c;Sorry, man.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dad politely waves and waits until they&#x2019;re both clear before cautiously stepping on the gas again. Go faster, for the love of slugs. I press my sore tongue against the inside of my teeth, testing the spot where I bit it. And as the drugged-out blond dude continues to scream at us, the boy with the scarred arm stares at me, wind blowing his wild, sun-streaked curls to one side. For a second, I hold my breath and stare back at him, and then he slides out of my view.<br> <br>Red and blue lights briefly flash in the oncoming lane. Great. Is this kind of thing considered an accident here? Apparently not, because the police car crawls past us. I turn around in my seat to see a female cop with dark purple shades stick her arm out the window and point a warning at the two boys.<br> <br>&#x201c;Surfers,&#x201d; Dad says under his breath like it&#x2019;s the filthiest swearword in the world. And as the cop and the boys disappear behind us along the golden stretch of sand, I can&#x2019;t help but worry that Dad might have exaggerated about paradise.</p><h2>Aviation Weather (2023): FAA Advisory Circular AC 00-6B (ASA FAA Handbook Series)</h2><p><p>This FAA Advisory Circular includes contributions from the National Weather Service (NWS).<br><br>This important Federal Aviation Administration Advisory Circular (AC) has been in circulation under a variety of titles for more than 70 years.

Why did so many people write stories about them?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a good question,&#x201d; Mrs. Brisbane said. &#x201c;Any ideas on why people might have thought dragons lived nearby?&#x201d;</p><p>The room was quiet for a moment.</p><p>I had no ideas at all. I would NEVER-NEVER-NEVER want to imagine there were real scary dragons!</p><p>Just-Joey raised his hand. &#x201c;Maybe people saw some big old bones&#x2014;like dinosaur bones&#x2014;and thought they were from something like a dragon. And maybe there was a forest fire and people thought the beast breathed flames that started the fire.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes!&#x201d; Thomas said. &#x201c;And then they started to imagine all kinds of things the dragon did.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Brisbane nodded. &#x201c;I think it might have happened like that.&#x201d;</p><p>I still wasn&#x2019;t sure.</p><p>The room was quiet until Not-Now-Nicole giggled. &#x201c;Maybe we should get a dragon for a classroom pet. One like my brother&#x2019;s.&#x201d;</p><p>It had been hard enough to get used to a frog as the other pet in Room 26. Especially a frog like Og, who makes a weird sound and has some odd habits. But a fire-breathing dragon?</p><p>&#x201c;NO-NO-NO!&#x201d; I squeaked.</p><p>The students sitting close to our table heard me and laughed.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, Humphrey,&#x201d; Thomas said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not getting a dragon&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because they&#x2019;re imaginary.&#x201d;</p><p>By that time, I wasn&#x2019;t even interested in an <i>imaginary</i> dragon.</p><p>&#x201c;Tell us about this dragon your brother has, Nicole,&#x201d; Mrs. Brisbane said.</p><p>&#x201c;Her name is Pearl and she&#x2019;s really beautiful,&#x201d; Nicole said.</p><p>My classmates burst out laughing.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t think what Nicole said was funny at all. She looked REALLY-REALLY-REALLY upset.</p><p>&#x201c;She is<i> too</i> real! I&#x2019;ll prove it to you,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call my mom right now. She&#x2019;ll tell you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not-Now-Nicole,&#x201d; Mrs. Brisbane said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time for us to get out our math books. You can explain later.&#x201d;</p><p>I usually try to learn along with my fellow classmates, even though I don&#x2019;t have a math book. But my eyelids got heavy and I slipped into my sleeping hut for a short nap.</p><p>When I woke up, I crawled back out and glanced across the table by the window where my cage sits.</p><p>Og was in his tank next to my cage. I think he was dozing, too, but it&#x2019;s hard to tell. Sometimes he closes his eyes but he&#x2019;s not even sleeping.</p><p>(I told you, he&#x2019;s a little odd.)</p><p>I glanced out of the other side of my cage and was unsqueakably happy to see that there was no pet dragon blowing hot smoke at me. Whew!</p><p>Then I looked toward the front of the room.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t know how long I&#x2019;d slept, but instead of writing numbers on the board, Mrs. Brisbane was talking about writing.</p><p>&#x201c;This is my favorite time in the school year,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Today, we start being writers. I know you all brought your writing notebooks today. Will you hold them up?&#x201d;</p><p>The students all held up notebooks, and each one was different.</p><p>Helpful-Holly&#x2019;s had big yellow sunflowers on it.</p><p>Tall-Paul&#x2019;s had a motorcycle on the cover, while Small-Paul&#x2019;s had a photo of the space shuttle.</p><p>I climbed up to the tippy top of my cage so I could see better. I saw smiley faces, princesses, polka dots and stars.</p><p>My friends in Room 26 have a lot of interests!</p><p>&#x201c;Once you start writing your ideas in your notebooks, you&#x2019;re on your way to being a writer,&#x201d; Mrs. Brisbane explained.</p><p>&#x201c;What if we don&#x2019;t have any ideas?&#x201d; Hurry-Up-Harry asked.</p><p>Some of my classmates giggled.</p><p>&#x201c;I mean, what if we don&#x2019;t have any ideas about what to write?&#x201d; Harry said.</p><p>&#x201c;We all have ideas,&#x201d; Mrs. Brisbane said. &#x201c;The notebook is a tool to help you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Like a hammer?&#x201d; Fix-It-Felipe asked. I know he likes hammers, because he can fix about anything.</p><p>More of my friends giggled.</p><p>Mrs. Brisbane laughed, too. &#x201c;In a way, yes. It&#x2019;s a tool to help you learn how to find ideas and develop them.&#x201d;</p><p>Helpful-Holly laughed. &#x201c;I think Felipe would rather have a hammer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All right, enough joking, class,&#x201d; our teacher said. &#x201c;To get you started, I&#x2019;m going to give you an assignment. Start by writing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; </p><p>She paused to write on the board.</p><p>If I could fly, I would fly like a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;And then fill in the blank however you like,&#x201d; she explained. &#x201c;You can start now, but the bell will ring soon, so bring in your completed work tomorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fly? Without a plane?&#x201d; Cassie asked.</p><p>&#x201c;You get to decide if it&#x2019;s a plane or a bird or anything you can imagine,&#x201d; Mrs. Brisbane said. &#x201c;Then I want you to write a sentence saying where you would go. This is the beginning of your assignment and eventually you will end up with a real story.&#x201d;</p><p>She pointed to her head. &#x201c;Use your imaginations. And spend some time thinking about your idea before you start writing.&#x201d;</p><p></p></p><h2>The Quantum Leap Strategy</h2><p><p>The Quantum Leap Strategy explains the unconventional set of behaviors that will bring breakthrough results for individuals or team members. </p><p> </p><p>Learn how to capture the magic of paradigm shifts, tap tremendous hidden potential, and tackle today s tough organizational problems using this original approach: </p><p> </p><p>*Go for a breakthrough </p><p>*Trust in the power of pursuit </p><p>*Get uncomfortable </p><p>*Open your gifts </p><p>*Focus on ends rather than means</p></p><p>you2 is the companion piece for this book.Price Pritchett is Chairman of Pritchett, LLC, a Dallas-based consulting, training and publishing firm.

The lovable pup, who would later earn the name Gobi, proved that what she lacked in size, she more than made up for in heart, as she went step for step with Dion over the Tian Shan Mountains, across massive sand dunes, through yurt villages and the black sands of the Gobi Desert, keeping pace with him for 77 miles.</p><p>As Dion witnessed the incredible determination and heart of this small animal, he found his own heart undergoing a change as well.&nbsp; Whereas in the past these races were all about winning and being the best, his goal now was to make sure he and Gobi&#x2019;s friendship continued well after the finish line.&nbsp; He found himself letting Gobi sleep in his tent at night, giving her food and water out of his own limited supply, and carrying her across numerous rivers, even when he knew it would mean putting him behind in the race, or worse, prevent him from finishing at all.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Dion did not cross the finish line first, he felt he had won something even greater &#x2013; a new outlook on life and a new friend that he planned on bringing home as soon as arrangements were made.&nbsp; However, before he could take her home, Gobi went missing in the sprawling Chinese city where she was being kept. Dion, with the help of strangers and a viral outpouring of assistance on the internet, set out to track her down, and reunite forever with the amazing animal that changed his life and proved to him and the world that miracles are possible.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Dion Leonard is a 41 year old Australian who lives in Edinburgh, Scotland with his wife Lucja. Dion has not only completed but competed in some of the world&#x2019;s toughest ultra marathons across the planet&#x2019;s most inhospitable landscapes. This includes running across the brutal Moroccan Sahara desert twice in the 250km Marathon Des Sables and also twice across South Africa's Kalahari Desert, also 250km. Dion's latest 250km race across the Gobi Desert in China turned out to be a completely different race where he fell in love with a stray dog (later named Gobi) that followed him during the week and who would change both of their lives forever.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>Craig Borlase (craigborlase.com) is a bestselling British author and collaborative writer of more than 45 books.

However, all of them teach these languages separately. Here you will find a comparative grammar of the four major Romance languages together based on their grammatical and lexical similarities for you, lovers of foreign languages, to learn and compare Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and French simultaneously. It is an audacious endeavor to find or create a novel way of learning to speak several languages and becoming a multilingual person. It took me over 3 years to finish the book. It consists of over 700 pages, 10 chapters covering all the grammatical aspects of these 4 languages. It includes over 1000 examples, 500 easy-to-follow charts and tables. It contains 138 geographical, historical and cultural facts about Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and French countries.Below I will discuss several reasons why I decided to write this book and why you need it.1) First of all, this book is written for readers like you who are fond of or would like to learn Spanish, Portuguese, Italian andFrench simultaneously or just to get an all-round knowledge of all these four Romance languages. It is designed not only for beginners who do not have an extensive knowledge of grammar, yet need a guide through the grammatical concepts of all mentioned above languages, but also intermediate and advanced students who would like to have a reference book ofseveral Romance languages at once.2) Second of all I spent many years learning these languages separately, which was a complete waste of time before I realized it. This book will hopefully save you a great deal of time and allow you to study and compare at a glance the four main Neo-Latin languages.3) Knowledge of foreign languages is fast becoming a necessary requirement for those who are involved in international business, tourism, culture and education. This book offers you four languages to learn, which will make you feel at homewherever you go, whether as a tourist or businessman.4) Learning several languages simultaneously or one by one will train and strengthen your memory and can help stave off such terrible diseases as Alzheimer&#x2019;s.5) If you have never studied several languages at once before and you like challenges, then you should definitely try it. Because it is a really entertaining and challenging task to do.In conclusion, I would like to sincerely thank you for preordering the book and your interest in it. I hope it will help you improve your languages and become multilingual.</p><p></p><h2>Find Your Yellow Tux: How to Be Successful by Standing Out</h2><p>Stop standing still.

The award-winning series cranks up the intensity with more action, more humor, and more romance as Greyson and his lovable friends discover the world is far more complicated and the terrorists far more sinister than they ever imagined. After thwarting a major terrorist attack, the twelve-year-old secret savior of thousands, Greyson Gray, is given a new identity and forced into seclusion to hide from the Eye of Eyes &#x2013; the most wanted man in the world and the leader of a rising terrorist group trying to divide the United States. But Greyson can only be secluded so long. Drawn toward suspicious activity at the massive Iowa State Fair, Greyson and his faithful friends uncover a plot even more insidious than before &#x2013; one that threatens the fibers of the nation and possibly the next president of the United States. For Greyson, everything is on the line &#x2013; his father&#x2019;s whereabouts, his relationship with Sydney, and the lives of everyone he loves. With new weapons, a new rival in love, and new enemies, there&#x2019;s no holding back. It&#x2019;s all fair game.</p><p><b>Interview with the Author</b><br>&nbsp;<br><b>Q:</b>&nbsp;Why should someone start the&nbsp;<i>Greyson Gray Series</i>?<br>&nbsp;<br><b>A:</b>&nbsp;The series is just basic fun. In&nbsp;<i>Camp Legend</i>, you fall in love with the quirky characters, their witty humor, and their admirable leader who reminds many of Indiana Jones - with a signature look, daring confidence, and a knack for trouble. Then, just when you get to know the kids, a spark is set to their world, erupting in an epic, dangerous adventure that threatens civil war. Even as the later books take Greyson and his friends into more intense action and maturity, there is still the humor and endearing qualities that keep you rooting for them to the end. It's the perfect entertaining mixture that readers love!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Q:</b>&nbsp;Why should parents get this series for their kids?<br>&nbsp;<br><b>A:</b>&nbsp;It's clean and features an admirable hero worth emulating. The hero, Greyson, has something inside of him that wants to do what is right and good, no matter the costs. This urge drives him in all of his adventures, even when it's difficult to know what is right and good. Also, his signature red hat has a white G on it that even he doesn't know what it stands for; but when enough people ask him, he decides that it stands for Good. He will fight for it even when he doesn't know everything and even though he's only twelve. The youngest generation needs this tenacity for truth and goodness more than ever. Finally, it has intense action - but no gore. It has romance; but it's innocent and clean.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It's also real - with real struggles and suffering. Greyson deals with a missing father, bullying, betrayal, girl-problems, and tough moral issues. At the same time, the series takes on many issues that are prominent in today's America including: tolerance, drone warfare, surveillance, bitter politics, and religion. These topics will be great to discuss around the dinner table or in the car.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Q:&nbsp;</b>What age is appropriate for these books?<br>&nbsp;<br><b>A:&nbsp;</b>I would let a public-schooled fifth grader read these books. Other parents may choose sixth or seventh grade while others may approve of younger kids. There are characters who die in suspenseful, intense action. There is no gore and no physical affection beyond light peck kisses. There is mild potty humor and use of the words "sucks," "frick," and "heck" (Book 3). &nbsp;It's also a great, nostalgic read for adults!<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Q:&nbsp;</b>What makes this series different than the rest?<br>&nbsp;<br><b>A:&nbsp;</b>Foremost, the series is set apart from many young adult books today because it is&nbsp;<i>pre-dystopian</i>. Many YA books are&nbsp;<i>dystopian</i>&nbsp;- meaning the country has already fallen and it is up to the protagonist to defy those that brought it down. This theme often leads to an entirely serious, almost depressing feel to the book. On the other hand, some YA books are entirely light-hearted, and readers never doubt that their beloved characters will come out on top. The&nbsp;<i>Greyson Gray Series</i>&nbsp;takes the best of both worlds, with light-hearted, lovable characters trying to prevent the collapse of the country. They have one foot in their hilarious childhood antics and the other in the adult world of purpose and desperation.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Besides that, the series has received loads of commendations for the biggest critics. But don't just take their word for it. Try it out yourself!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>The gist:</b> B.C. longs to edify and entertain the next generation, all while staying behind the scenes. While he initially wanted to direct movies, he now writes them in the form of novels. He loved reading as a child, especially the <i>Animorphs</i>, <i>Goosebumps</i>, and<i> Left Behind</i> series, so it is a joy for him to give young readers another beloved series to add to their bookshelves.<br><b></b><br><b>Other random bits of tid:</b><br><b></b><br><b>Favorite Food: </b>Wings.

We're not biblical experts&#x2014;though we may have started enough reading plans to be really familiar with Genesis. If we're honest, the Bible often intimidates us, confuses us, and reading it doesn't always thrill us. <p></p> <p>And yet, the Bible is where God reveals his loving character and incredible plan of redemption. In a practical and engaging manner, Matt Smethurst&#x2014;managing editor of The Gospel Coalition&#x2014;presents nine heart postures that will prepare you to unpack all that's awaiting you in God's Word. </p> <p>Although there are many great resources on how to read and study Scripture, hardly any focus exclusively on how to approach it in the first place. That's what Smethurst provides in this unique "prelude" to opening your Bible. For without the right heart postures, we're not yet ready to start reading.</p></p><p>Matt Smethurst is managing editor of The Gospel Coalition. He and his wife, Maghan, have three children and live in Louisville, Kentucky. They belong to Third Avenue Baptist Church, where Matt serves as an elder."Matt Smethurst is brilliant and creative. But more than that he is what every Bible teacher should be, and that is faithful. In <i>Before You Open Your Bible</i>, Matt reminds us of the significance of God's Word by focusing on the way we approach it as readers. This book will help you read Scripture in a deeper, more meaningful way." --<b>Russell Moore</b>, president, The Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention<br><br>"If you tend to grab your Bible, flip it open, and mumble a quick request for Holy Spirit-help, you are setting yourself up for something less than spectacular. But if you wish to hear the Spirit of Jesus speak life-altering words to you, it will mean laying aside your agenda, rallying your sensibilities, and remembering the majesty of the One who has words for you. Matt Smethurst has written a stellar little book on this rare but important subject. If you desire to approach your Bible as God wants you to, read this and be renewed." --<b>Joni Eareckson Tada</b>, Founder and CEO, Joni and Friends International Disability Center<br><br>"In our culture of productivity and efficiency, we desperately need to slow down and think about God's Word. This timely book by my friend Matt Smethurst teaches us how to humble ourselves and approach Scripture the right way. <i>Before You Open Your Bible</i> is filled with great wisdom about how you can reconnect with the power of the Christian life: God's Word. After reading this book, get alone with God and his Word, and be amazed at the grace that you find." --<b>Rick Warren</b>, founding pastor of Saddleback Church; author of <i>The Purpose Driven Life</i></p><h2>Color &amp; Learn Easy Italian Phrases for Kids (Dover Little Activity Books)</h2><p>These playful illustrations and their accompanying Italian words and phrases offer plenty of memorable fun for kids.

For thousands of years, sacred geometry has been a part of every culture. It is the bond that connects us all to the cosmos; it is the true design of our soul. Sacred geometry is the blueprint of creation at the core of all form even at the core of you. Quantum artist LON has created 44 Activations that encourage your analytical mind to step aside so you can enter the domain of the subconscious and the soul, and connect to the quantum field the space of infinite potential. Working with these cards on a daily basis will help you to think outside the box, create a deeper sense of peace in your life, and become a powerful conscious creator.</p><p>LON was born and raised in Holland, where she attended art school and worked in the advertising and graphic-arts industry. In the early 1990s, she discovered crop circles and instantly fell in love with their complex designs. It took over two decades for her to fully merge her (intrinsic) understanding and knowledge of sacred geometry and crop circles with her creative abilities; to not only build her life and reality around this union but to also make it her life s work to shift the collective consciousness, to question and shift existing paradigms, and to support the rebirth of the language of the soul. <p> LON now creates sacred geometry art images that are visual meditation tools, or Activations, that help people to navigate these changing times and activate thinking outside the box so that people can make real changes in their lives. Her Activations have been called living art, as they appear to be alive with energy, evoking powerful emotions and inspiring new thoughts. </p><p> LON lives in San Diego, California, and offers lectures and workshops, individual sessions, and intuitive counseling to support a new way of thinking and activate people toward becoming fully multidimensional human beings. She also creates personal Soul Activations based on an individual s unique energy, helping them to step into the highest expression of themselves.</p>"LON is a transcendental artist.

But that&#x2019;s just what Kelly Corrigan has set out to do here. In her <i>New York Times</i> bestselling memoirs<i>,</i> Corrigan distilled our core relationships to their essences, showcasing a warm, easy storytelling style.&nbsp;Now, in <i>Tell Me More,</i> she&#x2019;s back with a deeply personal, unfailingly honest, and often hilarious examination of the essential phrases that turn the wheel of life.<br><br> In &#x201c;I Don&#x2019;t Know,&#x201d; Corrigan wrestles to make peace with uncertainty, whether it&#x2019;s over invitations that never came or a friend&#x2019;s agonizing infertility. In &#x201c;No,&#x201d; she admires her mother&#x2019;s ability to set boundaries and her liberating willingness to be unpopular. In &#x201c;Tell Me More,&#x201d; a facialist named Tish teaches her something important about listening. And in &#x201c;I Was Wrong,&#x201d; she comes clean about her disastrous role in a family fight&#x2014;and explains why saying sorry may not be enough. With refreshing candor, a deep well of empathy, and her signature desire to understand &#x201c;the thing behind the thing,&#x201d; Corrigan swings between meditations on life with a preoccupied husband and two mercurial teenage daughters to profound observations on love and loss.<br><br> With the streetwise, ever-relatable voice that defines Corrigan&#x2019;s work, <i>Tell Me More</i> is a moving and meaningful take on the power of the right words at the right moment to change everything.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Tell Me More</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;It is such a comfort just knowing that Kelly Corrigan exists: she is somehow both wise and self-deprecating; funny but unafraid of pain; frank but gentle. She is the sister/mother/best friend we all wish we could have&#x2014;and because of this big-hearted book, we all get to.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Ariel Levy, author of <i>The Rules Do Not Apply</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;With full-bodied humor and radical sensitivity, Kelly Corrigan transforms the mundane pain of life into a necessary spiritual text of sorts, one that reminds us that we have the right to grieve but the obligation to be grateful. This book will remind you that you are human&#x2014;and of the fragile loveliness of being so.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Lena Dunham<br></b></p><p><b>Kelly Corrigan </b>has been called &#x201c;the voice of her generation&#x201d; by <i>O: The Oprah Magazine </i>and &#x201c;the poet laureate of the ordinary&#x201d; by<i> HuffPost. </i>She is the author of the<i> New York Times </i>bestsellers <i>The Middle Place, Lift, </i>and<i> Glitter and Glue</i>.

And, in fact, it didn&#x2019;t. I did.<br><br>I could say it was because my dad&#x2014;�whom I adored to the point of absurdity&#x2014;�had died sixty-�eight days before. I could say that watching him shrink into silence did me in, that grief bled me dry, that I was no longer a match for ordinary family life, that my radio station had lost the signal, the drone of static broken only by the occasional reception of two clear thoughts: He&#x2019;s gone and Please give him back.<br><br>But the truth is that I&#x2019;m always teetering between a mature acceptance of life&#x2019;s immutables and a childish railing against the very same. In the time it takes to get the mail, I can slide from sanguine and full of purpose to pissed off and fuming. As for perspective, there&#x2019;s a Hertz customer service rep in Des Moines who could release a tape of my recent &#x201c;feedback&#x201d; that would make the Internet break. All of which is not to say that I can&#x2019;t spot the difference between trivial and tragic. I can. I do. I genuflect in gratitude for my health, my husband, my kids, my central heating. I just can&#x2019;t stay bowed down. I keep popping back up, saying things like, Does anyone else&#x2019;s back hurt? In those moments, I&#x2019;m not that much closer to maintaining an adult frame of reference than I was the day I got my first period.<br><br>Speaking of menstruation, lack of perspective, and fits of irrationality, I have two teenage daughters. Georgia is sixteen, with Vidal Sassoon hair, almond-�brown eyes, flat feet, and one killer dimple. She likes lacrosse and Snapchat and prefers precalculus and chemistry to the humanities, where there are too many possible answers. Her interest in me hinges on allowance and rides; offering more, like an opinion, visibly chafes her. Her independence tortures and impresses me. She is a world-�class procrastinator who brushes her wet hair in the car on the way to the party and waits until we pull up to practice to put on her cleats. She is cool on a dance floor and sometimes, when she&#x2019;s telling me a story, I am as captivated by her as I have ever been by another human being.<br><br>Claire is fourteen, has blond hair that turns brown in the winter, size 12 shoes, dark blue eyes she gets from her father, and a smile that can be seen from space. She plays volleyball and basketball because we make her, lacrosse because she likes being outside in the spring. Without our interference, her extracurricular hours would be dedicated to the lyrics of Lin-�Manuel Miranda, decorating baked goods with special nozzles she found on Amazon, and throwing theme parties, six a year, pegged to the holidays. She designs her own invitations, finds snack and d�cor ideas on BuzzFeed, and plugs in a $14 disco light to energize the dance floor that is our deck. In fifth grade, she got every single answer right on a standardized test that was given over four days, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean she can spell &#x201c;skedule&#x201d; or &#x201c;arguement.&#x201d; We like to think she might be some sort of creative genius, but anything is possible.<br><br>When they&#x2019;re together, the girls are either watching reruns of The Office, ignoring each other in favor of whatever&#x2019;s on their cellphone, or squabbling over how to say Wingardium Leviosa. Sometimes, the way they go back and forth reminds me of the way Edward and I bicker, and I feel sure that if only we had modeled bipartisanship, our children would be better and happier. Once or twice a year, they do a Bollywood routine they learned from Just Dance and I&#x2019;m reminded of the days when being at home with each other was enough. When they do the Garth &amp; Kat skit from Saturday Night Live, I dare to believe I can see the faint edges of a future friendship.<br><br>That leaves Edward, my husband. Growing up, he was told he looked like Robby Benson of Ice Castles. Now he gets Ben Stiller. His obsessions are swimming, having the proper gear for any occasion, ensuring that each person he comes in contact with has seen and fully appreciated all five seasons of The Wire, and the Golden State Warriors. He fanboys their impetuous power forward, Draymond Green, whom he calls Sack Tapper after Green kicked several players in the nuts during the 2016 playoffs. Other than taking upward of ten days to unpack a suitcase and nagging me about going to the dentist, Edward is fairly easy to live with. He is not afraid of the grocery store or the stove and helps me color the very back of my hair, painting my gray roots Medium Brown 5 with the mini plastic brush that comes with the kit. He is deeply rational, has work that matters to him, and almost always holds my hand as we fall asleep even though he doesn&#x2019;t really like holding hands.<br><br>Me, I&#x2019;m all over the place. I look like my dad, and like both the girls in different ways. My hair is naturally curly but not in the sexy beachy way. If I were a dog, I&#x2019;d be the kind that&#x2019;s easier to shave down than to groom. I have been told I have large teeth. I&#x2019;m soft, and getting softer, and my ass is less pumpkin than helipad. To pretend I care enough to fix these things, I exercise every Saturday morning with Edward. I slow down when my forehead starts to shine&#x2014;�I&#x2019;m not a huge fan of showers. I wear the same clothes all week and often get past noon before putting on a bra or looking in the mirror. I prefer projects to jobs. I&#x2019;ve built &#x201c;furniture,&#x201d; been a &#x201c;photographer,&#x201d; and started a &#x201c;company.&#x201d; I am riddled with ideas, a dozen a day. My ambition waxes when I drink alcohol&#x2014;�one skinny margarita can have me filing to run for state senate&#x2014;�and wanes in the morning after the kids leave and I am alone with the work. The one absolutely good thing I do is volunteer for our local children&#x2019;s hospital. Every Tuesday, from three p.m. to five p.m., I hold babies in the NICU.<br><br>That&#x2019;s me, that&#x2019;s us.<br><br>So, this one morning . . .<br><br>I&#x2019;d slept okay. The usual five a.m. stumble to the loo, and back to the sack for another couple hours in bed until, like curtains snapping open, I am awake. There&#x2019;s bacon cooking&#x2014;�I can smell it&#x2014;�which puts Edward in the kitchen attending to his clockwork need for breakfast meats. I sit up, set my glasses on my nose to read the slight curve of my slippers. Left on left. Right on right. Another day begins.<br><br>After I quiet my white-�noise machine, the first sound I hear is a bit of edgy back-�and-�forth between the girls. Someone is wearing someone else&#x2019;s shirt. Without asking. Bickering bothers me much more than it bothers Edward. Edward can tolerate it all day, coming and going, while I launch into action at the first whiff. If smoke always leads to fire, the reasonable mind begs to know, why not douse the kindling before the place burns to the ground?<br><br>Here&#x2019;s why: Edward read a parenting book (just one) and the book said &#x201c;Let &#x2019;em fight!&#x201d;<br><br>As for the shirt, a $9 Circo crewneck from Target, it was purchased for Georgia. But last week, when I noticed it in her dresser, overflowing with options she hasn&#x2019;t considered since she committed full-�time to black leggings and a gray hoodie, I thought, Gee, I bet I could get Claire to wear this. I didn&#x2019;t think Claire would like it. I thought I could get her to wear it, so it wouldn&#x2019;t go unused. I need things to be used&#x2014;�the heel of the bread, the last page of the notebook, the rug from college. Our car has 148,412 miles on it.<br><br>So yeah, I gave Georgia&#x2019;s shirt to Claire. I did not ask permission.<br><br>While the shirt thing is going down in the hall, my daughters&#x2019; voices rising, the phone rings, which suggests, as it does in households across the world, that someone should answer it. But here at Crest Road, the ringing is a dog whistle and I&#x2019;m the only canine.<br><br>&#x201c;Edward! The phone!&#x201d;<br><br>He can&#x2019;t hear me, what with the crackling bacon, the exhaust fan it necessitates, and the squabble in the hallway.<br><br>I hustle to grab the upstairs phone, only to hear &#x201c;Hi! This is Joan from the Breast Cancer Awareness Fund, calling to talk to you about our Fun Run and Handbag Swap.&#x201d; Oh no, Recording &#x201c;Joan.&#x201d; No, you don&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;ve had breast cancer. Chemo, surgery, radiation, the whole Party Pak. I gave. Click.<br><br>Meanwhile, the girls are really getting into it. It&#x2019;s more than a shirt now; it&#x2019;s I always! and You never! and That&#x2019;s crazy! Then, Claire goes Real Housewives: &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t even know how to share, you selfish bitch!&#x201d;<br><br>I am standing over her in seconds. &#x201c;What did you just say?&#x201d; Fuck Edward&#x2019;s book.<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2014;�&#x201d; Claire starts to answer my rhetorical question.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you hear&#x2014;�&#x201d; Georgia says.</p><h2>Giant Rider-Waite� Tarot Deck</h2><p>Giant-sized version of the world&#39;s most popular tarot deck!</p><p></p><h2>We Will See Our Pets in Heaven: The Afterlife of Animals from a Biblical Perspective</h2><p>Biblical Evidence That Animals Really Do Go To Heaven. If you have pets or are grieving the loss of a pet then you must read this book. We love our pets and they love us. They become part of the family and it is painful when we have to say goodbye, however, you will be comforted to know that they are not gone forever as many people would believe. Inside this book you will get a glimpse of what heaven will be like and you will see that God loves and cares for his animals and there is indeed a place for them in heaven. In this book you will learn that animals are innocent and are not in need of salvation and that it was never our Heavenly Father&#39; desire that we or his animals would suffer death. The pets that we had to say goodbye to are alive in heaven right now in their spiritual bodies and we will see them again if we accept Jesus as our Savior. Your Pet Is Not Gone Forever. I know how hard it is to lose a pet. I&#39;ve had the pleasure of caring for many pets throughout my life and I am grief stricken every time one of them passes away. Dealing with the loss of a pet is difficult, especially when you&#39;ve been taught as a child and led to believe throughout the years by misinformed people such as parents, family, and friends that they are gone forever and that you&#39;ll never see them again. After losing my Black Lab back in December 2009 and then my Golden Retriever in 2011 I decided to find out for myself what the Bible had to say about the subject. What I found out was very comforting and I know you will be comforted too when you read this book.</p><p>Born October 1963, and a Christian since 1992. A love for animals and God&#39;s word.

Seth has a real job as a builder and the beach is within walking distance. Things seem to be looking up, until a storm warning is raised one sweltering afternoon. No one could have imagined anything like this. Giant walls of water crash in from the sea. Shingles and bricks are deadly missiles flying through the air.

The north wind remained brisk, and the dawn sky took on a mother-of-pearl iridescence unlike anything I&#x2019;d ever seen before. I stumbled more than a few times, foolishly staring at the sky instead of watching where I was going. <br>I turned south toward the construction site and soon found tide water over the tops of my shoes. Startled, I searched the faces around me but didn&#x2019;t see a flicker of concern. People still walked to work, trolleys ran, and horses pulled loaded delivery wagons same as always, splashing through the light overflow. I glanced down the street to the gulf where great waves broke on the beach, sending showers of white spray into the air. Storms and overflows might be a normal occurrence around here, but I wasn&#x2019;t sure I&#x2019;d ever get used to it. It made me feel like the whole island was sinking into the sea. <br>When I got to work, Mr. Farrell was already there, standing on the fourth house gallery, looking out over the beach. I climbed up beside him, and he pointed toward the streetcar trestle strung across the surf. Swells crashed against pilings and across rails, hurling plumes of white spray as high as telephone poles. Further down, spent waves had already reached the Midway. Fingers of foam raced around the ramshackle restaurants and shops as if searching for something to drag back into the sea. <br>We watched till everyone arrived, then Mr. Farrell put us to trimming doors and windows inside the first two houses. Concentrating on work wasn&#x2019;t easy, though. Even Zach had a hard time with such a spectacle going on outside.<br>Streets and yards around us filled with rain and tidewater, but still, people trickled in from trolleys, buggies, and on foot. Men in suits, dressed for work, and women gripping the hands of children gathered to see a sight as grand as fireworks on the Fourth of July. <br>As the morning wore on, the storm increased, and so did the crowds. Streetcars stopped three blocks short of the beach, no longer venturing out over the wild surf, and still people braved the rising water to see the show. Some of them even wore their bathing suits. <br>Skies darkened. Wind stripped umbrellas inside out and blew hats tumbling toward the surf. A driving rain soaked sightseers&#x2019; backs and peppered the north side of the house where I&#x2019;d been working, striking like pebbles against windows and siding. <br>I heard cries as waves picked up the two-wheeled, portable bathhouses and flung them into the row of flimsy buildings that made up the Midway, showering brightly painted pieces of wood over the roofs. Further down, swells rolled in, one upon the other, exploding against creosoted pilings under the Pagoda and slamming against floor joists with such force I could feel the gallery railing shudder beneath my hands. <br>Mr. Farrell shouted from the house next to us. &#x201c;Looks like it might get worse before it gets better. You boys best get on home.&#x201d;<br>Zach nodded and waved. We dropped our tools inside the unfinished parlor and headed out into the rain. <br>&#x201c;You live pretty far out, don&#x2019;t you, Seth?&#x201d; Zach asked. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome to come wait out the storm with us if you want.&#x201d;<br>I shook my head. &#x201c;Thanks, but I&#x2019;ll feel better knowing that things are okay at home.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I guess I would, too.&#x201d; He held up a hand. &#x201c;Monday morning, then.&#x201d;<br>I nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be here.&#x201d;<br>We all struck out in almost knee-deep water, headed toward higher ground--Zach with Frank and Charlie, and Henry with Mr. Farrell. Josiah and I trudged behind them but stopped when we heard excited yells behind us. We turned in time to see the Midway buildings lift on the waves and crash to the ground like kindling. Josiah gave me a stunned look as debris washed toward the shocked crowds. Many people turned to leave, but some stayed on, their faces lit with excitement.<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go,&#x201c; I yelled over the sound of the surf. Josiah nodded, and we bent our heads into the rain, wading toward the higher ground on Broadway where I hoped we&#x2019;d have an easier time of getting home. <br>Rising water and high curbs had turned the south streets into rushing, brown rivers, but buggies and drays still moved along them as if overflows were a daily occurrence. Kids floated by on homemade rafts or paddled along in washtubs, bumping into broken tree limbs and odd bits of bobbing lumber. They laughed while wet hair whipped around their faces. <br>Everywhere I looked I saw tiny green frogs, thousands of them, covering floating debris, sitting on fence posts and porches, and even riding astride a horse&#x2019;s back. <br>We waded out of the water just one block shy of Broadway and made our way west toward Thirty-Fifth Street. It wasn&#x2019;t long before I saw whole families struggling in from the beach roads just like we had, leaving their homes for higher ground. They carried clothing, food, and framed photographs, and ahead of them, they pushed muddy kids hugging kittens and puppies to their chests. <br>&#x201c;The bay and the gulf have joined!&#x201d; one of them yelled, pointing to the street. <br>I looked and saw water rushing in from Galveston Bay on one side and from the gulf on the other. The two seas met in the middle of Broadway, swirling over the wooden paving blocks, and I couldn&#x2019;t help but shudder at the sight. All of Galveston appeared to be under water. <br>When we reached Twenty-Fourth Street, I looked south toward the gulf, trying to keep an eye on the stalking sea. Wild waves rose up like a great hand and wrenched loose the Pagoda&#x2019;s long staircase, sending planks tumbling through the air. With horror I watched the end of one twin building sway and dip into the surf. <br>I yelled at Josiah, but my words disappeared on the wind. I grabbed his arm, pointed, and we stood together, shoulder to shoulder, mouths gaping, watching the impossible. <br>Like a wounded Goliath, the great bathhouse shuddered, folded in on its long legs, and collapsed into the sea. </strong><strong><strong>Copyright � 2006 Marian Hale<br>This text is from an uncorrected proof</strong></strong></p></p><h2>Good Night, Dora!

I always sit alone, and when I say always, I don&#x2019;t mean that in the exaggerated vernacular favored by my classmates. In the 622 days I&#x2019;ve attended this high school, not a single person has ever sat beside me at lunch, which is what justifies my calling her sitting there--so close that her elbow almost grazes mine--an &#x201c;event.&#x201d; My first instinct is to reach for my notebook and look up her entry. Under K for Kit, not under L for Lowell, because though I&#x2019;m good with facts and scholarly pursuits, I&#x2019;m terrible with names. Partly this is because names are random words completely devoid of context, and partly this is because I believe names rarely fit the people they belong to, which, if you think about it, makes perfect sense. Parents name their child at a time when they have the absolute least amount of information they will ever have about the person they are naming. The whole practice is illogical.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Take Kit, for example, which is not actually her name, her name is Katherine, but I have never heard anyone call her Katherine, even in elementary school. Kit doesn&#x2019;t in any way look like a Kit, which is a name for someone who is boxy and stiff and easily understandable with step-by-step instructions. Instead the name of the girl sitting next to me should have a Z in it, because she&#x2019;s confusing and zigzagged and pops up in surprising places--like at my lunch table--and maybe the number eight, because she&#x2019;s hourglass-shaped, and the letter S too, because it&#x2019;s my favorite. I like Kit because she&#x2019;s never been mean to me, which is not something I can say about the vast majority of my classmates. It&#x2019;s a shame her parents got her name all wrong.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&#x2019;m a David, which also doesn&#x2019;t work, because there are lots of Davids in the world--at last check 3,786,417 of them in the United States alone--and so by virtue of my first name, one would assume I&#x2019;d be like lots of other people. Or, at the very least, relatively neurotypical, which is a scientific, less offensive way of saying normal. That hasn&#x2019;t been the case. At school, no one calls me anything, except the occasional homo or moron, neither of which is in any way accurate--my IQ is 168 and I&#x2019;m attracted to girls, not boys. Also, homo is a pejorative term for a gay person, and even if my classmates are mistaken about my sexual orientation, they should know better than to use that word. At home my mom calls me son--which I have no problem with because it&#x2019;s true--my dad calls me David, which feels like an itchy sweater with a too-tight neck, and my sister calls me Little D, which for some inexplicable reason fits just right, even though I&#x2019;m not even a little bit little. I&#x2019;m six foot two and 165 pounds. My sister is five foot three and 105 pounds. I should call her Little L, for Little Lauren, but I don&#x2019;t. I call her Miney, which is what I&#x2019;ve been calling her since I was a baby, because she&#x2019;s always felt like the only thing in a confusing world that belongs to me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Miney is away at college, and I miss her. She&#x2019;s my best friend--technically speaking, my only friend--but I feel like even if I had friends, she&#x2019;d still be my best one. So far she&#x2019;s the only person I&#x2019;ve ever known who has helped make being me a little less hard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By now you&#x2019;ve probably realized I&#x2019;m different. It usually doesn&#x2019;t take people very long to figure that out. One doctor thought I might have a &#x201c;borderline case of Asperger&#x2019;s,&#x201d; which is stupid, because you can&#x2019;t have a borderline case of Asperger&#x2019;s. Actually, you can&#x2019;t really have Asperger&#x2019;s at all anymore, because it was written out of the DSM-5 (the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) in 2013, and instead people with that group of characteristics are considered to have high-functioning autism (or HFA), which is also misleading. The autism spectrum is multidimensional, not linear. The doctor was obviously an idiot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Out of curiosity, I&#x2019;ve done my own reading in this area (I bought a used DSM-4 on eBay; the 5 was too pricey), and though I lack the necessary medical training required to make a full diagnostic assessment, I don&#x2019;t believe the label applies to me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, I can get myself into trouble in social situations; I like order and routine; when I&#x2019;m interested in something, I can be hyperfocused to the exclusion of other activities; and, fine, I am clumsy. But when I have to, I can make eye contact. I don&#x2019;t flinch if you touch me. I tend to recognize most idioms, though I keep a running list in my notebook just in case. I like to think I&#x2019;m empathetic, but I don&#x2019;t know if that&#x2019;s true.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&#x2019;m not sure it really matters if I have Asperger&#x2019;s, anyway, especially because it no longer exists. It&#x2019;s just another label. Take the word jock. If enough psychiatrists wanted to, they could add that to the DSM and diagnose all the guys on the Mapleview football team. Characteristics would include at least two of the following: (1) athleticism, especially while wearing spandex, (2) unnatural ease with the concept of strapping a hard cup around your penis, (3) being an asshole. It doesn&#x2019;t matter whether you call me an Aspie or a weirdo or even a moron. The fact remains that I very much wish I were more like everyone else. Not the jocks, necessarily. I don&#x2019;t want to be the kind of guy who gives kids like me a hard time. But if I got the chance to make some sort of cosmic upgrade--switch David 1.0 to a 2.0 version who understood what to say in day-to-day conversation--I&#x2019;d do it in an instant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe when parents name their children they do it from the perspective of wishful thinking. Like when you go to a restaurant and ask for a rare steak, and even though there is no universally agreed definition of the word rare, you hope you get exactly what you want.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My mom and dad ordered a David. They got me instead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In my notebook:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>KIT LOWELL: Height: 5' 4". Weight: Approximately 125 lbs. Wavy brown hair, pulled into a ponytail on test days, rainy days, and most Mondays. Skin is brownish, because her dad--a dentist--is white and her mom is Indian (Southeast Asian, not Native American). Class ranking: 14. Activities: school newspaper, Spanish Club, Pep Club.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Notable Encounters</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1. Third grade: Stopped Justin Cho from giving me a wedgie.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixth grade: Made me a valentine. (Note: KL made all the boys valentines, not just me. But still. It was nice. Except for the glitter. Because glitter is uncontainable and has sticky properties, and I generally don&#x2019;t like uncontainable and sticky things.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. Eighth grade: After math class, she asked what I got on my math test. I said: 100. She said: Wow, you must have studied hard. I said: No, quadratic equations are easy. She said: Um, okay. (Later, when I reenacted the conversation for Miney, she told me that I should have said that I had studied, even if that meant lying. I&#x2019;m not a very good liar.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4. Tenth grade: Kit smiled at me when only our two names were announced as National Merit semifinalists on the loudspeaker. I was going to say &#x201c;Congratulations,&#x201d; but Justin Cho said &#x201c;Damn, girl!&#x201d; first and gave Kit a hug. And then she wasn&#x2019;t looking at me anymore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Important Characteristics</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1. On cold days, she stretches her sleeves to cover her whole hands instead of wearing gloves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. Her hair isn&#x2019;t curly, but it isn&#x2019;t straight either. It hangs in repetitive, alternating commas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. She&#x2019;s the prettiest girl in school.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4. She sits crisscross-applesauce on almost all chairs, even narrow ones.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5. She has a faint scar next to her left eyebrow that looks almost like a Z. I once asked Miney if she thought I&#x2019;d ever be able to touch that scar, because I&#x2019;m curious what it feels like, and Miney said, &#x201c;Sorry, Little D. But as the Magic 8 Ball says: My Sources Say No.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6. She drives a red Toyota Corolla, license plate XHD893.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Friends</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Almost everyone, but mostly hangs out with Annie, Violet, and sometimes Dylan (the Girl Dylan, not the Boy Dylan). Common characteristics of friend group, with the exception of Kit, include flat-ironed hair, minor acne, and larger than average breasts. For five school days last year, Kit walked the halls holding hands with Gabriel, only occasionally stopping to make out, but now they don&#x2019;t do that anymore. I don&#x2019;t like Gabriel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Additional Notes: Nice. Miney puts her on the Trust List. I second.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Of course I don&#x2019;t open the notebook in front of her. Even I know better than that. But I do touch its spine, because having it nearby makes me feel less anxious. The notebook was Miney&#x2019;s idea. Back in middle school, after the Locker Room Incident, which is irrelevant to this discussion, Miney decided I was too trusting. Apparently, unlike me, when most people talk they aren&#x2019;t necessarily telling the truth. See for example the Test Lie suggested above. Why lie about whether I studied for a test? Ridiculous. Quadratic equations are easy. That&#x2019;s just a fact.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;So your dad is dead,&#x201d; I say, because it&#x2019;s the first thing that pops into my head when she sits down. This is new information that I have not yet added to her notebook entry, only because I just found out. I&#x2019;m usually the last to know things about my classmates, if I ever learn about them at all. But Annie and Violet were talking about Kit at Violet&#x2019;s locker this morning, which happens to be above mine. According to Annie, &#x201c;Kit&#x2019;s been, like, a total mess since the whole thing with her dad, and I know it&#x2019;s been hard and whatever, but she&#x2019;s kind of being, I don&#x2019;t know, mean.&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t usually listen to the other kids at school--most of what they have to say is boring and feels like bad background music, something clanky and harsh, heavy metal, maybe--but for some reason this seeped through. Then they started talking about the funeral, how it was weird that they cried more than Kit, that it&#x2019;s not healthy for her to keep things bottled up inside, which is a ridiculous thing to say because feelings don&#x2019;t have mass, and also they are not doctors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I would have liked to go to Kit&#x2019;s dad&#x2019;s funeral, if only because he was also on my Nice List, and I assume when someone on your Nice List dies, you should go to their funeral. Kit&#x2019;s dad, Dr. Lowell is--was--my dentist, and he never complained about my noise-canceling headphones getting in the way of his drill. He always gave me a red lollipop after a cleaning, which seems counterintuitive and yet was always appreciated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I look at Kit. She doesn&#x2019;t look messy--in fact, she seems better groomed than usual and is wearing a man&#x2019;s white button-down shirt that looks recently ironed. Her cheeks are pink, and her eyes are a little wet, and I turn away because she is breathtakingly beautiful and therefore very hard to look at.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I wish someone had told me, because I would have gone to his funeral. He used to give me lollipops,&#x201d; I say. Kit stares straight ahead, doesn&#x2019;t respond. I take this to mean I should keep talking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe in heaven. I&#x2019;m with Richard Dawkins on that one. I think it&#x2019;s something people tell themselves to make the finality of death less scary. At the very least, it seems highly unlikely to me in the angels-and-white-cloud iteration you hear about. Do you believe in heaven?&#x201d; I ask. Kit takes a bite of her sandwich, still doesn&#x2019;t turn her head. &#x201c;I doubt it, because you are a highly intelligent person.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No offense or anything, but would you mind if we didn&#x2019;t talk?&#x201d; she asks. I&#x2019;m pretty sure this is not a question she wants me to answer, but I do anyway. Miney has put the expression no offense on the Be Wary List. Apparently bad things usually follow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d prefer it, actually. But I&#x2019;d like to say just one last thing: Your dad shouldn&#x2019;t have died. That&#x2019;s really unfair.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kit nods, and the commas of her hair shake.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yup,&#x201d; she says. And then we eat the rest of our sandwiches--mine peanut butter and jelly since it&#x2019;s Monday--in silence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But good silence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I think.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kit</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I don&#x2019;t really know why I decide not to sit with Annie and Violet at lunch. I can feel their eyes on me when I pass right by our usual table, which is at the front of the caf, the perfect table because you can see everyone from there. I always sit with them. Always. We are best friends--a three-person squad since middle school--and so I realize I&#x2019;m making some sort of grand statement by not even waving hello. I just knew as soon as I came in and saw them huddled together talking and laughing and just being so normal, like nothing had changed at all--and yes, I realize that nothing has changed for them, that their families are no more or less screwed up than they were before my life imploded--that I couldn&#x2019;t do it. Couldn&#x2019;t sit down, take out my turkey sandwich, and act like I was the same old reliable Kit. The one who would make a self-deprecating joke about my shirt, which I&#x2019;m wearing in some weird tribute to my dad, a silly attempt to feel closer to him even though it makes me feel like even more of an outcast and more confused about the whole thing than I was before I put it on. Just the kind of reminder I don&#x2019;t need. Like I could actually forget, for even a single minute.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I feel stupid. Could that be what grief does to you? It&#x2019;s like I&#x2019;m walking around school with an astronaut&#x2019;s helmet on my head. A dome of dullness as impenetrable as glass. No one here understands what I&#x2019;m going through. How could they? I don&#x2019;t even understand it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It seemed safer somehow to sit over here, in the back, away from my friends, who have clearly already moved on to other important things, like whether Violet&#x2019;s thighs look fat in her new high-waisted jeans, and away from all the other people who have stopped me in the hall over the past couple of weeks with that faux-concerned look on their faces and said: &#x201c;Kit, I&#x2019;m like so, so, so sorry about your daaaad.&#x201d; Everyone seems to draw out the word dad like they are scared to get beyond that one sentence, to experience the conversational free fall of what to say next that inevitably follows. My mom claims that it&#x2019;s not our job to make other people feel comfortable--this is about us, not them, she told me just before the funeral--but her way, which is to weep and to throw her arms around sympathetic strangers, is not mine. I have not yet figured out my way.</p></p><h2>A Little SPOT of Love (Inspire to Create A Better You!)</h2><p><b>Everyone NEEDS to be loved! </b> But sometimes its hard to figure out how to LOVE someone the way they want to be LOVED.

Do you know who you&#39;re meant to be? Do you know how to find the answers to questions like these? Knowledge of Self is the result of a process of self-discovery, but few of us know where to begin when we&#39;re ready to start looking deeper. Although self-actualization is the highest of all human needs, it is said that only 5% of people ever attain this goal. In the culture of the Nation of Gods and Earths, commonly known as the Five Percent, students are instructed that they must first learn themselves, then their worlds, and then what they must do in order to transform their world for the better. This often intense process has produced thousands of revolutionary thinkers in otherwise desperate environments, where poverty and hopelessness dominate. Until now, few mainstream publications have captured the brilliant yet practical perspectives of these luminary men and women. Knowledge of Self: A Collection of Writings on the Science of Everything in Life presents the thoughts of Five Percenters, both young and old, male and female, from all over the globe, in their own words. Through essays, poems, and even how-to articles, this anthology presents readers with an accurate portrait of what the Five Percent study and teach, as well as sound direction on how to answer timeless questions like: Who am I, and why am I here? Why is there so much injustice in the world, and what can be done about it? Who is God and where on Earth is he? How do I improve myself without losing myself? Why are people of color in the situations they&#39;re in? What can we do about the global problems of racism and poverty?</p><p>Supreme Understanding did his doctoral dissertation on methods employed by the Nation of Gods and Earths to turn around the lives of at-risk Black and Latino youth.

Watching your bright, vibrant child struggle with ADHD can make you feel helpless, especially when you don&#x2019;t have the tools to help them succeed. There is a great deal of help available for children with ADHD, but there simply aren&#x2019;t enough resources for parents of ADHD children&#x2014;and you need support just as much as your child.</p> <p>The National Institute of Mental Health recognizes that frustration, blame, and anger are common in families with ADHD children. Children with ADHD need guidance and understanding from parents to reach their full potential. Yet it can feel impossible to manage the challenges you experience as a parent in order to be the support your child needs.</p> <p>Diane Dempster and Elaine Taylor-Klaus are ADHD coaches, educators, and the cofounders of ImpactADHD.

There are a ton of "experts" telling you what to do. We are focused on helping YOU figure out HOW to make all that advice work for your family.

But I can also guarantee that SOMETHING in this book will speak directly to you -- and will work for you -- if you give yourself permission to pace yourself, to learn, to practice, to tweak, to try again. We know this is a challenge -- to "fail forward" in the process of learning -- and it is our gift to you, as we (hope to) teach you to share this gift with your kids. Nothing, truly, will help your kids more than learning how to ask for and accept help in life -- and we hope to help you practice that with this book. :-)&nbsp;<br>Please -- let us know what you think!!<p><strong>ELAINE TAYLOR-KLAUS</strong>, PCC, CPCC, is a certified coactive coach, public speaker, author, educator, and cofounder of ImpactADHD.

The <strong>accordion-fold pocket size travel map </strong>includes tram lines, metro lines, and water bus.

Before or after a journey through the Netherlands, spend some time here and enjoy the atmosphere of a beautiful European city without the jarring intensity of a larger urban environment. From the winding waterways to its world famous museums, there's much to see and do in Amsterdam, though finding your way around the canal system can be confusing, so don't forget your STREETWISE� Amsterdam city map. </p> <p>The STREETWISE� Amsterdam Map will enable you to visit all the cool and cultural sites. Walk among the 17th and 18th century architecture, join with the fleets of bicycles to tour the city or just meander through leafy <strong>Rembrandt Park</strong> to experience the funky mix of locals and foreign backpackers. Whether you want to walk or take public transport to the famous <strong>Rijksmuseum</strong>, the STREETWISE� Amsterdam Map will help get you there. <strong>Dam Square,</strong> about five minutes' walk south of the main station, is the center of town and much more is within walking distance. <strong>Leidesplein</strong>, with much of the city's cultural life and nightlife, <strong>Rembrandtplein</strong> and <strong>Musemplein</strong> are just a few of the special places that make Amsterdam a joy to explore on foot or bike. </p> <p>A complete index of hotels, points of interest, cultural sites, and parks, are clearly listed, as well as tram lines and museum boat stops.

We've set the standard that every map company has imitated but never duplicated. Our mission is to make you feel comfortable, to make you feel safe in a place where you've never been before and to enable you to experience a familiar place more fully.<p>The company was founded in 1984 by Michael Brown, who had been in international publishing for many years, setting up subsidiaries for textbook publishers. In the 1970's, Brown traveled extensively throughout Africa, India, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Brown would take a large paper map, cut out the city center, folded it up and slip it into his pocket, thus preventing him from looking like a tourist in areas where discretion is the better part of travel. This was his tool for surviving.</p><p>After many years on the road, Brown settled back in New York and decided to start his own business, based on the adaptations he had made to maps in his travels. His goal was to give someone the ability to navigate easily in unfamiliar terrain.</p><p>He started with a new map format: the accordion fold. Such a simple idea, but at the time it was revolutionary. No more struggling to fold an awkward, oversized paper map. This new format would enable the user to blend in like a native, instead of stick out like a tourist. Brown then added lamination to ensure that the map would be a lasting tool.</p><p>More important than the format was the design of the map itself. It had to be a map that not only succeeded above and beyond any map he had used, but was esthetically appealing as well. The look of it had to be as striking as the functionality. Color was introduced in a way that was never seen before in a map - vivid purple for water, soothing gray for the background of street grids, gold to highlight elements of the map. Clarity, conciseness and convenience in a very stylish package.</p><p>Building the business was a 24 hour job. Brown sold the maps during the day, zipping around Manhattan making deliveries on his Harley Davidson. At night he packed the orders and did the design work.

He lives in New Jersey with his wife, Karen; their formerly feral cat, Not Ootie; and their adopted terrier, Amelie.<i>Starred Review.</i> The stars of the <i>Mutts</i> comic strip, Mooch the cat and his canine friend, Earl, break out of the Sunday funnies into the picture book world. McDonnell applies his spare style, sketching his cheeky characters with only a few deliberate lines. Each has a distinctive feature&#x2014;Mooch's red ellipse-shaped nose, Earl's Princess Leia ears&#x2014;that makes them instantly endearing. With plain backgrounds, a limited palette and a small square trim size, the book looks like a blown-up cartoon strip (even the pages have a newspaper-like grittiness). But the story has more depth than the minimalist visuals would suggest. Here, Mooch searches for the perfect gift for Earl. "What do you get someone who has everything?" he wonders. (Earl is the proud owner of a bowl, bed and chewy toy.) Mooch mulls it over (red and black dots and bubbles indicate his deep thinking) and comes up with "<i>Nothing</i>! He would give Earl the gift of nothing." But where to find nothing? Mooch tries shopping (because "Millie came home from the store and said, 'There was nothing to buy!' "). But alas, "nothing was not for sale." How he solves the problem is pure delight, reminding young readers that the greatest gift is friendship, not things. Both <i>Mutts</i> fans and newcomers will appreciate McDonnell's clever wordplay and lovable characters, who prove that nothing can be everything.

Nesbit (Author) </b><br> Edith Nesbit (1858-1924) is perhaps most famous for writing <i>The Railway Children</i> and <i>Five Children and It</i>, but she was extremely prolific and wrote or collaborated on more than sixty children's books. Nesbit is today recognised as one of the most influential and innovative children's writers that ever lived, and is cited as an inspiration by many contemporary authors, including J. K. Rowling, Neil Gaiman, Jacqueline Wilson, Kate Saunders and Frank Cottrell-Boyce. Even C. S. Lewis acknowledged the debt his Narnia series owed to her work - particularly the Bastable and Psammead trilogies.<br><br>In this sequel to THE TREASURE SEEKERS, the Bastable siblings spend a summer making mischief in the English countryside. The wonderfully imaginative children form a society for the doing of good deeds--with unfailingly disastrous and amusing results. Their adventures (seamlessly abridged) are presented as vignettes with snatches of music in between. Teresa Gallagher sounds unerringly like children should sound. She's completely convincing as both the boys and the girls (and the grown-ups)--and she's particularly successful in the narrating voice of Oswald, who is the anonymous teller of these adventures. Edith Nesbit's strikingly modern British classic is just as welcome--and feels just as relevant--today.

In these pages, I want to share my years of travel and baking with you through these recipes for a variety of breads and the meals, from a simple sandwich on the street to elaborate dinners, that I have enjoyed with them.<br><br> Bread, in its myriad forms, is eaten the world over. I have long been fascinated with how breads have developed alongside different cuisines and how they fit in with their way of eating. Some cultures put bread on the table for every meal, at the ready to sop up any sauce, while elsewhere, the centerpiece of a meal is a variety of sliced breads that are served with an assortment of toppings. In France, it is not uncommon to serve extra bread alongside a croque monsieur.<br><br> This book is not a comprehensive catalog of world bread and cuisines; it is more personal than that. Instead it is drawn from my own travels and baking experiences over the last thirty-odd years. The book is also informed by what I have learned eating bread in different places, which is that bread traditions developed alongside a complementary culinary tradition. This idea first germinated with me while I was teaching the Art of International Bread Baking, the professional baking program at the French Culinary Institute in New York City. At the time,&nbsp; each six-week course was divided into two-week sections for French, German, and Italian breads. Academically, I understood that each culture had its own approach to making bread, but my own travels and time spent living abroad informed me even more about how these breads were eaten in different locations. My time spent breaking bread at tables showed me how the food and the bread fit together.<br><br> Sometimes there is a particular bread that is eaten with a dish or type of food, like the dark French rye bread, <i>pain de seigle</i>, that is served with oysters and other raw seafood. Other breads, like the salt-free bread of Tuscany, can be bewildering until they are eaten with the boldly flavored and often salty local specialties. Sandwiches play their part in all of these cultures, and can range from a simple buttered baguette with thinly shaved ham to a sauce-drenched, five-napkin affair like the<i> torta ahogada</i> from Guadalajara.<br><br> The breads in this book are presented with a culinary context, from a German Brotzeit to a French baker&#x2019;s meal to Tuscan bread with a hunter&#x2019;s stew. Each chapter explores one of the bread-baking traditions that have influenced my career and is followed by a section that puts those breads on the table with recipes for traditional food pairings. I find these pairings transporting, and I hope you will explore them with me.<br><br> How I Learned to Eat Bread<br><br> In the late summer of 1981, I landed at Kastrup Airport in Copenhagen to begin a year as a high school exchange student. Like countless others before me, I was about to start an adventure that would change and influence my life in ways that were unimaginable at the time. Even so, I never would have predicted that it would be my first step toward becoming a bread baker. In truth, it would be another four years before I kneaded my first dough. But when my host father, Hans-Erik Jons�n, and his son, Michael, brought me back to their home outside of Halmstad, Sweden, I discovered&nbsp;foods and breads I had never tasted before, and other ways of eating that were as foreign as the language.<br><br> Both of my parents were from the Midwest. (We moved from northern Minnesota to the Florida Panhandle when I was ten.) They were adventurous cooks; they belonged to a gourmet club, staging elaborate multicourse meals every month or so with several other couples. We always ate well at home. My dad especially liked to try new and different recipes and considered James Beard his culinary hero. Neither of them baked much, though. They made pies, birthday cakes, and cookies with my sister and me, but the only bread I remember was packaged white bread, mostly for sandwiches or toast. I probably had a sandwich or two on rye as my mom&#x2019;s father loved a good Reuben, but the rye available then was barely distinguishable from white bread. So when four or five varieties of bread appeared on the table every morning and evening in Sweden, it was a revelation to me.<br><br> In Sweden, two meals each day, breakfast and the evening meal, revolve around bread. Slices from several loaves and some <i>kn�ckebr�d</i>, a crispbread, were placed in a basket on the kitchen table, along with a parade of toppings that came out of the refrigerator and cupboard.<br><br> In fact, there is a word, <i>p�l�gg</i>, which comes from <i>p�</i> meaning &#x201c;on&#x201d; and <i>l�gga</i> meaning &#x201c;to lay.&#x201d; <i>P�l�gg</i> is everything that you lay on top of <i>br�d</i> (bread). Cold cuts (such as ham), summer sausage, salami, cheeses, honey, p�t�, pickles, and occasionally some pickled fish and salmon roe in a tube were set out on the table with a tub of butter in the center. Everyone had a small wooden board and a wooden spreader to build their own <i>sm�rg�s</i>, or open-faced sandwiches. The Jons�n family always had a pot of tea as well.<br><br> Around noon, we would have <i>middag</i> (it literally translates to &#x201c;midday&#x201d; but means dinner) which is traditionally the one hot meal of the day. Interestingly, bread was not typically served at&nbsp;<i>middag</i>. More often than not, potatoes were the starch. I loved the sauces and gravies, especially when we went to eat with my host father&#x2019;s parents, as his mother was a great cook. I made sure I soaked up every last bit of sauce or gravy with the potatoes.<br><br> Britt, my host mother, was also a great cook. Even better, she was a great baker. Each month she would go to her mother&#x2019;s house for a baking day. Those evenings, she would come home with her share of the spoils and load the cupboard and freezer with a month&#x2019;s supply of cinnamon buns and cookies for <i>fika</i>, the all-important Swedish coffee break. My favorite, though, were the loaves of <i>fullkornsbr�d</i>, dense rye bread studded with cracked rye and rolled in wheat bran. While most of our daily bread came from the grocery store, and it was far better than any bread we could buy at the Piggly Wiggly, these homemade loaves were extra special. Dense and dark, the cracked rye gave the thin slices a pleasant chew. My favorite topping was shavings of farmers&#x2019; cheese, its dairy twang melding with the earthy, caramelly sweetness of the bread.<br><br> Around town, there were PSA billboards encouraging&nbsp;people to eat at least seven slices of bread a day. Based on my experience in the Jons�n family, the encouragement hardly seemed necessary, but I suppose it signaled a change in eating habits that had started even then, as Swedes began eating more fast food and lunches on the go and shifting toward eating <i>middag</i> at the end of the day.<br><br> Learning Swedish piqued my interest in languages, so I decided to study German at the University of Florida in Gainesville. For my junior year of college, I won a scholarship from the Federation of German-American Clubs to study in Munich. Living in student housing and attending university was quite different from my stay with a family in Sweden, but one thing was familiar&#x2014;great bread and lots of it. I found so many dark and toothsome varieties of rye breads, some of which reminded me of the Swedish breads I had grown to love and crave, but there were also many new types. I have heard it said that there are&nbsp;more than three hundred different rye breads made<br> throughout Germany.<br><br> Living in the student housing, called Studentenstadt, meant that I did not experience the typical rhythm of a family&#x2019;s day and meals. Constrained by my age and budget, many of my meals were eaten in the university canteen or at one of the student-run pubs in the Studentenstadt. Restaurant meals were few and far between. When we did eat out, it was often some cuisine other than German, such as Greek, or when I was especially homesick, Mexican. In the student pubs, we were more likely to have an Asian-influenced one-pot meal, a vegetable curry, or perhaps a Moroccan stew. Though my status as a student partially dictated these choices, there was also a national trend toward Mediterranean and Eastern cuisine during my time in Germany, in part due to a curiosity of the world and relatively inexpensive travel opportunities, but also shaped by a certain amount of reluctance in claiming too much of their Germanness.<br><br> One of my favorite rituals and fondest memories is of the brunch that we had nearly every Saturday in the common room on our floor of the Studentenstadt. Unlike my American college dorms, we each had our own room with a private bath and a kitchenette. On Saturday mornings, someone would run to the bakery for fresh rolls, a couple of people would brew coffee, someone else would make a pot of tea, and we would all converge on the common room with whatever we might have in our fridges&#x2014;cheese, cold cuts, or yogurt&#x2014;and we would have a meal together. Always fresh from the bakery, among the white rolls known as <i>semmeln</i>, were pretzels. My best friend, Martin, taught me the Bavarian way to eat them, with butter.<br><br> When I returned to Gainesville and chicken wings, burritos, pizza, and garlic knots, there were two things that I really missed from Germany: great beer and great bread. One day, as I was browsing the bookstore near campus, I came across a copy of <i>Beard on Bread</i>. I thought of my father and his dog-eared James Beard cookbooks and decided to&nbsp;give bread baking a try, as this seemed like the only way I would taste great bread without getting on a plane. Starting with the basic white bread recipe, I worked on kneading and proofing and baking simple breads with dynamite flavor.</p><h2>The Complete Bible Prophecy Chart (6-Panel Foldout)</h2><p><p>A panorama of the ages on one full-color master chart created by prophecy experts Tim LaHaye and Thomas Ice!

This particular skeleton can't seem to shake them--not in the shower (nice fuzzy bat slippers!), not while brushing his teeth (woops! there goes the bottom jaw!), not while polishing his bones, carving a pumpkin, raking leaves, or even when playing baseball with his friend Ghost. Ghost, instead of Boo-ing! away his buddy's hiccups right away as we might expect, advises Skeleton to hold his breath and eat some sugar and drink water upside down. When he finally does Boo! it still doesn't work. But when Ghost finds a mirror and holds it up to Skeleton's face, he sees his reflection and screams in fright! The hiccups jump away, hic, hic, hic. While it's novel to see a skeleton eating sugar, drinking water, showering, etc., it may be tricky to find the right audience for this unusual picture book that's more about hiccups than Halloween.

They descend from the skies. They have a hunger for human flesh. They are everywhere. They are parasites, alien creatures who must invade&#x2013;and take control of&#x2013;a human host to survive. And once they have infected their victims, they can assume any deadly form they choose: monsters with giant teeth, winged demons, creatures with blades for hands. But most have chosen to conceal their lethal purpose behind ordinary human faces. So no one knows their secret&#x2013;except an ordinary high school student. Shin is battling for control of his own body against an alien parasite, but can he find a way to warn humanity of the horrors to come?</p><p>Grade 10 Up&#x2014;An unknown number of tennis-ball-sized spores falls to Earth, each containing an organism intent on taking over the brain of a human being, metamorphosing its head into a mutable alien killer. Shinichi is attacked by one of these parasites but uses a tourniquet to stop its progress in his arm. The next morning he finds that his right hand has become a sentient creature that requires his circulation system to continue living. The creature is eventually named Migi and exists in a curious balance with Shinichi, as it needs him to survive but was originally supposed to kill him and use his body to kill still more people. Migi's partial possession brings Shinichi into contact with other parasites that have successfully taken over their hosts, and who are involved in mass murders of various degrees of subtlety. The light horror tone of the book allows for mild gore and successful suspense. The thoughtful plot developments are accompanied by workmanlike artwork, effective enough with the xenomorphic bits, but lacking flair in executing the more mundane situations. The closing preview for the second volume makes it seem as if the artist has matured, however, and the story's potential is likely to leave readers wanting further exploration.&#x2014;<i>Benjamin Russell, Belmont High School, NH</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Grisly and surreal, this story of an alien invasion gives the phrase "talk to the hand" a whole new meaning. Alien spores roughly the size of tennis balls fall to earth one night; from within crawl sluglike creatures that burrow their way into the brains of humans, effectively killing them and taking over their bodies. Young Shinichi is wearing headphones when one tries to attack him, and it ends up taking over his hand instead. The hand talks to him&#x2014;in time, he names it Migi ("right")&#x2014;and begins devouring books to learn more about the new "host race." Meanwhile, other invaders are devouring people, touching off a worldwide string of horrid murders; the invaders can sense one another, and a clue in a late chapter hints at some sort of purpose for their trip to Earth. Violence is graphic and often shocking, depicted in a style reminiscent of western comics and H.R. Giger. The ordinary nature of the rest of the illustration gives the whole book an unsettling edge, a sort of subliminal "it could happen anywhere" vibe. A cult favorite manga, this was originally released in the U.S. by Tokyopop in the '90s, but Del Rey is presenting a new translation and it should find an eager audience. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

That's why thousands of parents and educators have turned to the solutions in <i>Setting Limits With Your Strong-Willed Child</i>.

He begins his typical day by refusing to wear the clothes his mother picks out, then dawdles for the next twenty minutes while she prods and pleads with him to put them on. When he arrives at the breakfast table, he turns up his nose and complains that he doesn&#x2019;t like what&#x2019;s offered. This is not a battle I want to fight, his mother says to herself as she prepares Corey his own special meal. She tells her husband that she worries about Corey&#x2019;s nutrition, but what she really worries about is the tantrum Corey will throw if he doesn&#x2019;t get what he wants. Her husband thinks she&#x2019;s too soft on Corey and so do her two daughters. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not fair!&#x201d; they complain. &#x201c;He always gets his own way.&#x201d; By the time Corey makes it out the door in the morning, his mother is ready for a nap. But this is only the beginning. Round two begins in the afternoon when Corey returns from preschool. Sometimes Corey&#x2019;s mother wonders how long she can take it.<br><br>Six-year-old Kristal is sweet and cooperative one moment, angry and defiant the next. Little things set her off&#x2014;unexpected changes, departures from routine, or simply things not working out her way. Tantrums are not uncommon. &#x201c;Living with Kristal is like riding on a roller coaster,&#x201d; says her mother. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s exhausting!&#x201d; Kristal&#x2019;s parents alternate between punishing and giving in, depending upon how worn down they feel; but nothing seems to make any difference. They wonder if Kristal&#x2019;s behavior is normal and question whether they did something to cause her to behave this way.<br><br>Nine-year-old Alex has a short fuse and often acts before he thinks. When things don&#x2019;t go his way at school or in the neighborhood, Alex gets loud, calls names, threatens, and sometimes hits other kids. Alex has been suspended from school three times this year for being disrespectful to teachers and fighting on the playground. It&#x2019;s only December. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too bad they don&#x2019;t spank kids at school anymore,&#x201d; Alex&#x2019;s father laments. &#x201c;When Alex acts like a brat at home, we give him an earful, then we paddle him. He has to learn. We&#x2019;ve threatened to take away his TV privileges for the rest of the year if he gets suspended again.&#x201d;<br><br>Lynn, age twelve, is destined to be a great trial lawyer. She&#x2019;s bright, intense, and very persistent. Lynn will argue with anyone if she thinks there&#x2019;s a chance of getting things to work out her way, and she&#x2019;s willing to use drama, rudeness, and disrespect when she believes it will help her win her case. &#x201c;I never would have imagined talking to adults the way she talks to us,&#x201d; Lynn&#x2019;s father complains. &#x201c;We reason with her every way we know, but everything turns into an argument.&#x201d;<br><br>Do any of these children sound familiar? If your child resembles one of these, you&#x2019;re not alone. I see more than a hundred children each year whom parents and teachers describe as challenging, difficult, spirited, stubborn, hell-raising, a pistol, or just plain impossible. Although no single term adequately describes all, or even most, of the children I see, the one that comes closest is &#x201c;strong-willed.&#x201d; These are normal children with extreme behavior who are hard to raise and difficult to discipline.<br><br>Strong-willed children are not part of some conspiracy to make life difficult for others. They just do what strong-willed children do. They test harder and more often, resist longer, protest louder, use more drama, and carry things further than most of us would ever imagine. They&#x2019;re movers and shakers, powerful kids who bring out strong reactions in others.<br><br>Teachers and principals know them as the 10 to 15 percent who cause 90 percent of school discipline problems. Parents know them as their big challenge. I know them affectionately as &#x201c;my kids&#x201d; because I spend a lot of my time with them, both at work and at home. Yes, I&#x2019;m the proud parent of a strong-willed son. My youngest son is a delight, but he&#x2019;s also a workout, and he&#x2019;s not the least bit impressed by the fact that I write books on this subject or that I&#x2019;m supposed to know what to do. At home, I get no breaks or professional immunity. He pushes hard against my rules and authority. At times, I&#x2019;ve wondered whether his behavior is normal.<br><br>Strong-willed children are not part of some conspiracy to make life difficult for others. They just do what strong-willed children do. They test.<br><br>Do you sometimes question whether your child&#x2019;s behavior is normal? Perhaps you worry that you&#x2019;ve done something to cause your child to behave this way. If so, you&#x2019;ll be relieved to know that the problem, in most cases, is not parents. Most are doing the best they can with the discipline tools they have. The problem is not the child, either. Most strong-willed children are just being themselves. The real problem is a bad match between the child&#x2019;s temperament and the parents&#x2019; discipline methods. The parents&#x2019; tools are not well suited for the job. The predictable result&#x2014;conflict and power struggles.<br><br>When parents arrive at my office looking for help in dealing with their strong-willed child, one of my first tasks is to assist them in understanding their child&#x2019;s temperament. Then we examine how their discipline tools match up with their child&#x2019;s temperament and discuss the predictable conflicts and friction points that develop around a bad match. That&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re going to do in this chapter. A new perspective awaits you. You&#x2019;re not the problem, but you are a big part of the solution. Improving the match is well within your control.<br><br>Who Is This Strong-Willed Child?<br><br>My youngest son, Ian, is a great force in our family and a great source of pride and joy. He&#x2019;s bright, creative, sensitive, and very determined. Sometimes, I think he&#x2019;s more determined to train his parents than we are to train him. He keeps us on our toes. If we are unclear, inconsistent, or indecisive when we ask him to do something, Ian lets us know. He holds out for a clearer signal.<br><br>Like most strong-willed children, Ian understands the &#x201c;bottom line,&#x201d; and he knows how to get there. He just pushes hard until he finds it, and when he does, he pushes a little more to see whether it holds up. If it does, he stops pushing, at least for a while, and accepts the boundary. But Ian pushes a lot before he gets there. It&#x2019;s wearing! My older son, Scott, usually cooperates for the asking without all the pushing.<br><br>How would you react if you asked two children to cooperate in the same respectful manner and got two consistently different responses? Would you become upset? Would you question whether something is wrong?<br><br>The persistent testing that is so characteristic of strong-willed children is also what drives most parents crazy. Why would anyone do this? I&#x2019;d ask myself. Is this normal? I would never push anyone as hard as Ian pushes me.<br><br>Does your child push hard against your rules and authority? Has he or she done so from an early age? Do you react in extreme ways and question whether your child is normal? Join the club. Now it&#x2019;s time to get better acquainted with your child. Following are some basic facts about strong-willed children that will help you better understand your child and your reactions to his or her behavior.<br><br>The persistent testing that is so characteristic of strong-willed children is also what drives most parents crazy.<br><br>� Strong-willed children are normal. You&#x2019;ve probably worried about whether your child is normal when his teacher or a well-intended relative pointed out that his behavior seems extreme. They&#x2019;re right, but extreme does not mean abnormal. Most strong-willed children are normal with well-defined temperament traits. They&#x2019;re not brain damaged, emotionally disturbed, or defective. Most have no diagnosable problems at all, though some do. In addition, no rule says you can only have one thing going on in your life at a time. Some strong-willed children also have learning disabilities, hyperactivity, and other special needs, but a strong will does not mean they are abnormal.<br><br>� Strong-willed children are not all alike. Each strong-willed child is a special individual with his or her own unique temperament. No two behave in exactly the same way. Sure, they all test parents and behave in extreme ways, but they don&#x2019;t all test in the same way or to the same degree. Some are easier. Others are more difficult. Some are almost impossible.<br><br>� Strong-willed children are hard to understand. Our individual temperament shapes the way we think, learn, and behave. When others think and behave as we do, we can readily identify with them and understand their experience. When others think, learn, and behave very differently from us, however, it is not easy to understand them or to identify with their behavior. Why would anyone do that? we ask ourselves. The behavior makes no sense from our perspective. Strong-willed children are hard to understand for exactly this reason. As you learn about your child&#x2019;s temperament and how that temperament shapes the way your child behaves, behavior that once seemed confusing should begin to make sense.<br><br>When others think, learn, and behave very differently from us, it is not easy to understand them or to identify with their behavior.<br><br>� Strong-willed children require a lot of guidance and discipline. Of course, this statement sounds obvious: Children who test frequently require frequent discipline. Yet when you accept this statement as a fact of life rather than a source of annoyance, your attitude and perspective changes. Mine did. I stopped feeling so angry and resentful when my son tested me and developed patience I didn&#x2019;t believe was possible. I realized that his job was to test, and my job was to guide him in the right direction. Those are the hands each of us were dealt. My new perspective didn&#x2019;t change his behavior, but it sure made my life a lot easier. I stopped taking it personally.<br><br>� Strong-willed children do not respond to discipline methods that seem to work with other children. Why do children respond so differently to the same request? One cooperates, the other resists. Is the problem the resistant child? Or the request? Most parents feel confused when their best guidance efforts work with one child but not with another. The issue is less confusing when we consider the individual temperaments involved. Compliant children will cooperate with most discipline approaches, even ineffective ones, because their underlying desire is to cooperate. They have a different learning style than their strong-willed counterparts. Compliant children permit parents a wide margin for ineffectiveness. Strong-willed children, on the other hand, do not respond to ineffective discipline. They require clear, firm, and consistent guidance. Ineffective discipline is a fast lane to power struggles with a strong-willed child.<br><br>Ineffective discipline is a fast lane to power struggles with a strong-willed child.<br><br>� Strong-willed children learn differently than their peers. Strong-willed children do much of their learning &#x201c;the hard way.&#x201d; That is, they often need to experience the consequences of their own choices and behavior before they can learn the lesson we&#x2019;re trying to teach. It&#x2019;s not enough just to announce that kicking the soccer ball in the house is not okay. Strong-willed children need to experience having the ball taken away for a while each time they decide to test the rule and kick the ball anyway. They may need to repeat this drill many times before they accept the rule as mandatory. Their behavior is not malicious, but can be very frustrating and confusing because it is so unlike that of compliant children who cooperate the first time they&#x2019;re asked. Parents must learn to accept that &#x201c;hard-way learning&#x201d; is good learning for strong-willed children.<br><br>� Strong-willed children bring out extreme reactions in others. How do you feel when your child challenges your rules and authority? Angry? Frustrated? Confused? Threatened? Intimidated? Embarrassed? Guilty? Inadequate? Discouraged? Exhausted? All of the above? These are all normal reactions to extreme behavior. Strong-willed children often place strain on a marriage, cause sibling conflicts, and create other problems within the family.<br><br>The traits of strong-willed children that drive many of us crazy can actually become strengths when we give our kids the understanding and guidance they need to choose the right path.<br><br>� With proper guidance, strong-willed children can develop into dynamic, cooperative, and responsible individuals. Once you discover that your child has a strong will, the next question is: How are you going to deal with it? Your options are clear. You can fight with it and try to control it. You can give in to it and let it control you. You can try some of both. Or you can accept your child&#x2019;s strong will as a fact of life, make peace with it, and learn better ways to guide him or her down a healthy path. The choice is yours. The traits of strong-willed children that drive many of us crazy can actually become strengths when we give our kids the understanding and guidance they need to head down the right path.<br><br>Discovering Your Child&#x2019;s Temperament<br><br>When my son was born, there was no tag attached to his heel that said: Caution! Strong-willed child. Handle with Care. There were no warnings at all. I discovered his temperament the way most parents do. I watched it emerge as he grew up.<br><br>I had clues about his temperament from the beginning. He was colicky and screamed a lot during his first few months. He was picky and finicky when we introduced solid foods. Mornings were the hardest. He was slow to get going and cranky. For some reason, his schedule never seemed to match up with the rest of ours.<br><br>But Ian didn&#x2019;t put his cards out on the table until he was eight and a half months old. One Saturday morning, while I was sitting on the couch reading the newspaper, I saw Ian pull himself up to a standing position. Watch out! I thought to myself. We&#x2019;re entering the furniture-walking phase. His older brother went through this phase about the same age, and I thought I knew what was ahead. But to my amazement, Ian let go of the furniture and walked all the way across the living room! When he got to the end, he plunked down, then pulled himself up and did it again. Wow!<br><br>I called my wife in the other room to come see Ian walk. When she arrived, I tried my best to get him to do it again. I pleaded, begged, coaxed, and cajoled, but Ian wouldn&#x2019;t budge. He just sat there with this look on his face that said, Watch out. I&#x2019;m Ian. Nearly two weeks went by before he walked again; but when he did, he did it the way he prefers to do most things&#x2014;on his terms. Looking back, I realize this was one of those defining moments.</p><h2>The Christmas Story</h2><p><b>Hope and joy radiate from the pages of Robert Sabuda&#x2019;s new pop-up book celebrating the Nativity.</b><br><br>Long ago in the town of Bethlehem, on a bright and starry night, a baby was born, a child who was called the son of God.

Beauty and pharmaceutical companies work overtime to convince people to purchase products that will retain their youthful appearance and vitality. Wrinkles are embarrassing. Gray hair should be colored and bald heads covered with implants. Older minds and bodies are too frail to keep up with the pace of the modern working world and olders should just step aside for the new generation. </p><p>Ashton Applewhite once held these beliefs too until she realized where this prejudice comes from and the damage it does. Lively, funny, and deeply researched, <i>This Chair Rocks</i> traces her journey from apprehensive boomer to pro-aging radical, and in the process debunks myth after myth about late life. Explaining the roots of ageism in history and how it divides and debases, Applewhite examines how ageist stereotypes cripple the way our brains and bodies function, looks at ageism in the workplace and the bedroom, exposes the cost of the all-American myth of independence, critiques the portrayal of elders as burdens to society, describes what an all-age-friendly world would look like, and offers a rousing call to action. </p><p>It&#x2019;s time to create a world of age equality by making discrimination on the basis of age as unacceptable as any other kind of bias. Whether you&#x2019;re older or hoping to get there, this book will shake you by the shoulders, cheer you up, make you mad, and change the way you see the rest of your life.

Yet quietly, under the radar, a small number of companies have rejected the pressure of endless growth to focus on more satisfying business goals. Goals like being great at what they do, creating a great place to work, providing great customer service, making great contributions to their communities, and finding great ways to lead their lives.<br><br>In&nbsp;<i>Small Giants</i>, veteran journalist Bo Burlingham takes us deep inside fourteen remarkable companies that have chosen to march to their own drummer.

What we wear can identify who we are: what team we play for or what team we root for, where we go to school, how we worship, or how we represent our heritage. What we wear expresses our individuality, and clothes can make us happy, confident, and proud. Whether it&#x2019;s a piper in a tartan plaid, a cowpoke in a cowboy hat, or a novice in ceremonial face paint, children everywhere wear different clothes and accessories for different reasons. But, one thing they all have in common is that they are all unique and beautiful. Backmatter encourages young readers to explore the way people dress in other countries and other cultures at folk festivals, at museums, and at home by asking about their own family heritage.</p><p>Maya Ajmera is the founder of The Global Fund for Children. She is the co-author of several Global Fund for Children books, including FAITH, GLOBAL BABIES, CHILDREN OF THE U.S.A., and CHILDREN FROM AUSTRALIA TO ZIMBABWE. Elise Hofer Derstine is a writer and farmer. She lives in Goshen, Indiana. Cynthia Pon worked for many years as the director of Global Fund for Children Books and is the co-author of several books, including FAITH, CHILDREN OF THE U.S.A., and others.Celebrating global clothing and costumes, this book offers a collection of crisp, color photographs showing children dressed in widely varied ways for school, sports, play, and celebrations. The country of origin appears in a corner of each picture. A large print text runs throughout the book, threading together the loosely organized pictures into a narrative with phrases such as, We wear all the colors of the rainbow.../and paint our faces, and wear masks. Illustrating that one sentence are photos on double-page spreads, showing children in Ukraine, Ecuador, Iran, Brazil, Martinique, Canada, and the Philippines. The composition and clarity of the photos make these fine pictures, while the children s faces make them riveting. An appended section, titled Discover Different Cultures, encourages readers to visit folk festivals, explore museums exhibiting clothing, and learn about the family origins, as well as how masks and costumes are made. An excellent addition to preschool and primary multicultural units. --Booklist</p><h2>What I Like About Me!</h2><p>The kids in <i>What I Like About Me</i>, are as different as night and day.

Genesis tells us who God is, who we are, how things went wrong, and the plan that God has put in place to return the earth to the way it was meant to be.</p> <p>This guide helps us see how the storyline of Genesis foreshadows and connects to the good news about Jesus, and offers penetrating exegetical insights for those of us seeking to better understand God's plan to bring blessing to all nations.</p></p><p><p><strong>Mitchell M.

Kent Hughes</strong><strong>, </strong>Professor of Practical Theology, Westminster Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;<em>Knowing the Bible</em> brings together a gifted team of Bible teachers to produce a high quality series of study guides. The coordinated focus of these materials is unique: biblical content, provocative questions, systematic theology, practical application, and the gospel story of God&#x2019;s grace presented all the way through Scripture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Philip Graham Ryken</strong><strong>,</strong> President, Wheaton College</p><p>&#x201c;These <em>Knowing the Bible</em> volumes introduce a significant and very welcome variation on the general run of inductive Bible studies. Such series often provide questions with little guidance, leaving students to their own devices. They thus tend to overlook the role of teaching in the church. By contrast, Knowing the Bible avoids the problem by providing substantial instruction with the questions. Knowing the Bible then goes even further by showing how any given passage connects with the gospel, the whole Bible, and Christian theology. I heartily endorse this orientation of individual books to the whole Bible and the gospel, and I applaud the demonstration that sound theology was not something invented later by Christians, but is right there in the pages of Scripture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Graeme Goldsworthy</strong><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;Former Lecturer in Old Testament, Biblical Theology, and Hermeneutics, Moore Theological College</p><p>&#x201c;What a gift to earnest, Bible-loving, Bible-searching believers! The organization and structure of the Bible study format presented through the <em>Knowing the Bible</em> series is so well conceived. Students of the Word are led to understand the content of passages through perceptive, guided questions, and they are given rich insights and application all along the way in the brief but illuminating sections that conclude each study. What potential growth in depth and breadth of understanding these studies offer. One can only pray that vast numbers of believers will discover more of God and the beauty of his Word through these rich studies.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Bruce A.

Not exactly the color of her hair, but close. Checking her reflection in the back of her cereal spoon, she thought they looked surprisingly natural.<br><br>On the table in front of her was a wrinkled sheet of homework. It wasn&#x2019;t homework yet, actually. Aside from her name, the paper was blank. She itched to draw a small, round Martian in the upper left-hand corner.<br><br>Instead, she put down the spoon, picked up her pen, and wrote:<br><br>What is love?<br><br>This was her assignment: answer the question &#x201c;What is love?&#x201d;<br><br>In full sentences.<br><br>She looked at the empty blue lines on the page and tried to imagine them full of words.<br><br>Love is __________.<br><br>Her mom had once told her that love was a kind of music. One day, you could just . . . hear it.<br><br>&#x201c;Was it like that when you met Dad?&#x201d; Bridge had asked. &#x201c;Like hearing music for the first time?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I heard the music before that,&#x201d; her mom had said. &#x201c;And I danced with a few people before I met Daddy. But when I found him, I knew I had a dance partner for life.&#x201d;<br><br>But Bridge couldn&#x2019;t write that. And anyway, her mom was a cellist. Everything was about music to her. <br><br>Bridge squeezed her eyes closed until she saw glittery things floating in the dark. Then she started writing, quickly.<br><br>Love is when you like someone so much that you can&#x2019;t just call it &#x201c;like,&#x201d; so you have to call it &#x201c;love.&#x201d;<br><br>It was only one sentence, but she was out of time.<br>Bridge had noticed the cat ears earlier that morning, on the shelf above her desk, where they&#x2019;d been sitting since the previous Halloween. They felt strange at first, and made the sides of her head throb a tiny bit when she chewed her cereal, but as she walked toward school, the ears became a comforting presence. When she was small, her father would sometimes rest his hand on her head as they went down the street. It was a little bit like that.<br><br>Bridge stopped just outside the front doors of her school, slipped her phone out of her pocket, and texted her mom:<br><br>At school.<br><br>XOXO, her mom texted back.<br><br>Bridge&#x2019;s mother was on an Amtrak train, coming home from a performance in Boston with her string quartet. Bridge&#x2019;s father, who owned a coffee place a few blocks from their apartment, had to be at the store by seven a.m. And her brother, Jamie, left early for high school. His subway ride was almost an hour long.<br><br>So there had been no one at home that morning to make her think twice about the cat ears. Not that anyone in her family was the type to try to stop her from wearing them in the first place. And not that she was the type to be stopped.<br>Tabitha was next to Bridge&#x2019;s locker, waiting. &#x201c;Hurry up, the bell&#x2019;s about to ring.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; Bridge faced her locker and puckered up. &#x201c;One, two . . .&#x201d; She leaned in and kissed the skinny metal door.<br><br>&#x201c;Nice one. You can stop doing that anytime, you know.&#x201d;<br><br>Bridge spun her lock and jerked the door open. &#x201c;Not until the end of the month.&#x201d; Seventh grade was the year they finally got to have lockers, and Bridge swore she was going to kiss hers every day until the end of September.<br><br>&#x201c;You have ears,&#x201d; Tab said. &#x201c;Extra ones, I mean.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; Bridge put both hands up and touched the rounded tips of her cat ears. &#x201c;Soft.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re sweet. You gonna wear them all day?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d; Madame Lawrence might make her take them off, she knew. But Bridge didn&#x2019;t have French on Mondays.<br><br>If she had French on Mondays, life would really be unfair.<br>The next day she wore them again.<br><br>&#x201c;Un chat!&#x201d; Madame Lawrence said, pointing as Bridge took her seat at the very back of the room. And Bridge&#x2019;s head tingled in the way that happens when someone points. But that was all.<br><br>By Wednesday, the ears felt like a regular part of her.<br>Valentine&#x2019;s Day<br><br>You paint your toenails. You don&#x2019;t steal nail polish, though.<br><br>Vinny calls you chicken: all of her polish comes from the six-dollar manicure place. Every month, she puts another bottle in her pocket while the lady is getting the warm towel for her hands. You told her you want to be a lawyer and can&#x2019;t be stealing stuff. Vinny rolled her eyes. Then Zoe rolled her eyes. Vinny&#x2019;s eye-rolls are perfect dives, but Zoe always tries too hard. Her lids tremble and her eyeballs look like they might disappear into her head.<br><br>Your mother is shouting that it&#x2019;s time to leave for school. You suck in air and shout back: &#x201c;Just a minute!&#x201d; You are not going to school. She doesn&#x2019;t realize that, of course.<br><br>It turns out that, in high school, not painting your toenails is considered disgusting. You blow on your wet toes, little puffs. &#x201c;So much for the freshman-year perfect-attendance certificate,&#x201d; you tell yourself.<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Your mother is standing in the doorway looking impatient.<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; you say.<br><br>She squeaks about your flip-flops, how it&#x2019;s February, but you tell her it&#x2019;s fine, it&#x2019;s not so cold, there&#x2019;s no gym today, and nobody cares.<br><br>Really you are just going to hang out in the park until she leaves for work. Then you will come back home.<br>Your feet are ice. The flip-flops were a stupid idea--what were you thinking? The playground swings are freezing and your hands ache, but you hold on, walk yourself back a few steps, and let your body fly.<br><br>It feels wonderful.<br><br>The playground is deserted. It&#x2019;s too early for little kids to be out, especially in February, and everyone else is where you&#x2019;re supposed to be: at school. On your way to the park, you had to dodge Bridge Barsamian, struggling with a big cardboard box, those tatty-looking cat ears she&#x2019;s been wearing since September peeking over the top. You sidestepped into a bodega just in time.<br><br>You lean forward and swing back, lean back and swing forward.<br><br>Straight ahead of you is the big rock where you played when you were little. There&#x2019;s a divot in it, a crater where everyone dumped acorns, leaves, grass, those poison red berries if there were any. You poured them from your shirt-hammocks into the crater and poked the mess with sticks. &#x201c;Dinner!&#x201d; You&#x2019;d all sit in a circle, and Vinny would dare everyone to lick their berry-stained fingers. She was always in charge--even then, before you understood it, her beauty was hard to look away from: glossy dark hair and full red lips. Snow White with a tan and a strut.<br>It&#x2019;s windy on the little platform at the top of the wooden climbing tower. The short walls are covered with messages scrawled in thick marker, big sloppy hearts and dirty words. When you were small, you would swing yourself up legs-first, but now you have to stick your head through the opening in the floor and then hoist the rest. You certainly have grown, you tell yourself.<br><br>You sit on the rough plank floor and wedge your back into the nearest corner, the one that was always yours. You can almost see them, in their places: Vinny to the left, Zoe to the right. They&#x2019;re not your friends anymore. They&#x2019;re both other people now. The girls you can see looking back at you are gone. No one talks about these disappearances. Everyone pretends it&#x2019;s all right.<br><br>Remember the time you found a beer bottle up here? It was empty, but the three of you took turns holding it, staggering around and pretending to drink--though never touching it to your lips; that would have been disgusting. You felt almost drunk for real.<br><br>Vinny&#x2019;s father had been there that afternoon, seen you, and demanded that you all come down. He took the empty bottle with one hand and jerked Vinny&#x2019;s arm with the other, dragging her toward a garbage can. She tried to cover, acting like she was just walking along next to him, double-time.<br>You check your phone. Your mom was getting into the shower when you left. You wonder if she has left for work.<br><br>You can see the sun touching the tops of the buildings across the street, making its way through the neighborhood like someone whose attention you are careful not to attract. It&#x2019;s still shady in the playground. But aside from the loneliness, and the cold, it&#x2019;s all exactly the same. If you keep your own body out of sight, you could be nine years old again.<br>Another Book on Top<br><br>When Bridge came back to school in fourth grade, after the accident, Tabitha introduced her to Emily. And then Tab and Emily showed Bridge how they drew little animals on their homework, in the upper left-hand corners of their papers, underneath their names. Tab always drew a funny bird, and Emily always drew a spotted snake.<br><br>They said that Bridge should choose an animal to draw in the upper left-hand corners of her homework, and then they would be a club.<br><br>Bridge announced that she was allergic to clubs, that she would rather be a set, like in math. Her mother had homeschooled her. Actually, a lot of it had been hospital school.<br><br>&#x201c;A set?&#x201d; Tab repeated.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Bridge said. &#x201c;We could be the set of all fourth graders who draw animals on their homework papers.&#x201d;<br><br>That night, Bridge thought about what her animal should be. A cat? A frog? She decided she would draw a Martian, with a circle body, a circle mouth, two feet but no legs, and three eyes.<br><br>The next day, she showed her Martian to Tab and Emily, feeling shy. But Tab clapped when she saw it, and Emily said &#x201c;Awesome!&#x201d; And then the three of them held up their papers in a kind of circle on the lunch table, so that their animals could see one another.<br><br>&#x201c;Is a Martian an animal, though?&#x201d; Bridge asked.<br><br>&#x201c;A Martian is a creature,&#x201d; Tab said. &#x201c;And so is a snake. And so is a bird.&#x201d;<br><br>And from then on, they were the set of all fourth graders who drew creatures on their homework. More than that, they were friends.<br><br>The next year, Bridge, Tab, and Emily were the set of fifth graders who drew creatures on their homework papers, and they drew the same things they had drawn before: bird, snake, and Martian. Their friendship grew stronger, like a rope that thickened little by little. On the Monday after spring vacation, Emily sighed, rested her chin on the lunchroom table, and said, &#x201c;Can sets have rules?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Bridge said.<br><br>&#x201c;What rules?&#x201d; Tab asked, suspicious.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s only one rule,&#x201d; Em said. &#x201c;No fighting.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No fighting?&#x201d; Bridge said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, just--no fighting. Okay?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But we have to swear on something,&#x201d; Tab said. She put her second Twinkie in the middle of the table. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s swear on this.&#x201d;<br><br>Em smiled. &#x201c;The magic Twinkie of no fighting?&#x201d;<br><br>They each ate a third.<br><br>When middle school started, they were the set of sixth graders who drew creatures on their homework and did not fight. That was the year Em&#x2019;s parents got divorced. The rope became even stronger.<br>In seventh grade, things were different. Not the rope. Other things.<br><br>First of all, now Emily had a &#x201c;body.&#x201d; Bridge could see this for herself, and Tab&#x2019;s older sister, Celeste, who was in high school, confirmed it:<br><br>&#x201c;Look at Emily with the curvy new curves!&#x201d;<br><br>It had happened quickly. Bridge heard her mother telling her father that Emily&#x2019;s &#x201c;growth spurt&#x201d; made her think of those silent four-year-olds who suddenly start speaking in full sentences.<br><br>Seventh grade had sports teams and foreign languages. Emily turned out to be not only the second-fastest runner in the grade but also one of the best players on the girls&#x2019; JV soccer team, and now even the eighth graders said hi to her. And Tab, who had always spoken French at home but almost never raised her hand at school, became kind of a know-it-all. Madame Lawrence, who was very strict, sometimes chatted and laughed with Tab before class. In French.<br><br>Bridge was horrible at French.<br><br>And then Bridge&#x2019;s English teacher handed back the first homework assignment of the year. He had circled her three-eyed Martian and written No doodling on homework, please. Next time I will take off points.<br><br>When she showed Emily and Tab and asked if anyone had drawn big red circles around their creatures, they looked at each other and admitted that they hadn&#x2019;t drawn anything on their homework in the first place.<br><br>&#x201c;You guys.&#x201d; Bridge dropped her arm so that her paper slapped her thigh. &#x201c;Seriously?&#x201d;<br><br>Emily grabbed Bridge&#x2019;s hand and said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re still a set. We&#x2019;re the set of all seventh graders who used to draw stuff on their homework.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And who don&#x2019;t fight,&#x201d; Tab added. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget the Twinkie.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; Em said. She looked at Bridge. &#x201c;Forever.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And ever,&#x201d; Tab said.<br><br>But Bridge understood that life didn&#x2019;t balance anymore. Life was a too-tall stack of books that had started to lean to one side, and each new day was another book on top.<br>Maybe<br><br>Emily had long legs, and her chest jiggled a little when she moved. She probably jiggled exactly the right amount. And it didn&#x2019;t slow her down on the soccer field. At all.<br><br>&#x201c;Wow, she just exploded,&#x201d; Bridge heard someone say after Em scored a goal during the first game of the season. But she wasn&#x2019;t sure if it was Emily&#x2019;s speed or her body that was exploding. She and Tab watched the kids running back and forth in the knee-high dust. It was almost October but still summer-hot.<br><br>&#x201c;So what&#x2019;s with the ears?&#x201d; Tab asked.<br><br>Bridge shrugged. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re ears.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a week. How long are you going to wear them?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Bridge could feel Tab studying her, but she didn&#x2019;t turn her head. &#x201c;Maybe until it rains?&#x201d; She touched the cat ears carefully with four fingers. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want them to get wet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d; Tab asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Bridge said.<br>On the last day of September, Bridge kissed her locker for the last time and Emily got a text from a boy. It had not rained. Bridge was still wearing the ears.<br><br>The text was from an eighth grader. It said: S&#x2019;up?<br><br>&#x201c;Wild,&#x201d; Em said.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you gonna text him back?&#x201d; Tab asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; Emily said.<br>On the first day of October, Emily got a text from a boy asking for a picture.<br><br>&#x201c;Same boy,&#x201d; Em said. &#x201c;That eighth grader. His name is Patrick. Very cute, actually. And he plays soccer.&#x201d; They were sitting against the fence after Emily&#x2019;s second win.<br><br>&#x201c;A picture of what?&#x201d; Tab asked, pulling at the dry grass. She was stirring up dust that made Bridge want to sneeze.</p><h2>Alcoholics Anonymous: Reproduction of 1st Edition</h2><p>5.5x8.5 softcover reprint of the first printing of the first edition of Alcoholics Anonymous.<br><br>* The entire original and unchanged text and stories.<br><br>* Includes a section detailing where the main text differs from the modern 3rd and 4th Edition text. <br><br>The differences range from little things like:<br> Page 111: <br>He will use that as an excuse to drink more.<br><br> originally read: <br>He will use that as an excuse to drink some more.<br><br>To significant changes like:<br> Step 12: <br>Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.<br><br> originally read: <br>Having had a spiritual experience as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.<br> <br> Page 151: <br>As ex-problem drinkers, we smile at such a sally.<br><br> originally read:<br>As ex-alcoholics, we smile at such a sally.</p><p></p><h2>Teens Cook: How to Cook What You Want to Eat [A Cookbook]</h2><p><b>Cooking for teens, like finding the perfect gift for teen boys and girls, is almost impossible. </b><br><br>Teenagers like what they like, and they will <i>only</i> eat what they like. But instead of causing mealtime strife, now they can learn to cook those foods themselves. With over 75 delicious recipes for meals at all times of the day&#x2014;breakfast, snacks, sides, dinners, and dessert, too&#x2014;<i>Teens Cook</i> is a guide to everything teenagers (and tweens) need to learn about conquering the kitchen without accidentally setting the house on fire. Written by teens and for teens in easy-to-follow instructions, authors Megan and Jill Carle give young readers advice on how to maneuver their kitchen in a language they&#x2019;ll understand (and actually listen to). The Carle sisters pass on their knowledge of how to decipher culinary vocabulary, understand kitchen chemistry (why stuff goes right and wrong when cooking), adapt recipes to certain dietary restrictions (like vegetarianism), and avoid all sorts of possible kitchen disasters. <br><br><i>Teens Cook</i>&nbsp;is not only a fantastic teen gift&#x2014;it&#x2019;s the perfect cookbook to inspire young adults to take interest in their diets, and empower them to try a new and tasty hobby.</p><p><b>MEGAN CARLE</b> and <b>JILL CARLE</b> are both graduate students at Arizona State University. They published their first cookbook, TEENS COOK, while Jill was still in high school, and followed up with TEENS COOK DESSERT and COLLEGE COOKING.<br><br><b>JUDI CARLE </b>has served as chef/author, project coordinator, and general editor on more than 20 cookbooks, including the best-selling Charlie Trotter series and, most recently, <i>Shakespeare'�?s Kitchen.</i> The Carles all live in Phoenix, Arizona.Grade 7 Up&#x2013;Sisters Megan and Jill Carle love to cook, both from recipes and experimenting with what's on hand. When they eat something they love in a restaurant, they try to re-create it at home. If they find a complicated recipe, they fearlessly "take shortcuts that would probably give a chef hives." The result of their culinary passion is this appealing mix of 85 diverse recipes ranging from comfort food to sushi. The six sections include traditional American cuisine, as well as recipes for German, Chinese, and Mexican dishes. Basic cooking instruction is incorporated into the recipes themselves as well as in the sidebars sprinkled liberally throughout. The gently wry introductions for each recipe offer keen glimpses into the siblings' personalities and relationship, adding to the intimacy and warmth of this cookbook. Megan, a vegetarian, offers advice on adapting many of the recipes to her diet. "Kitchen Disasters" offer amusing accounts of mistakes made by the Carles or their relatives, complete with explanations of exactly why things went awry. The clear instructions and striking, full-color photos will equip teen chefs to undertake their own adventures, but the reliance on butter, cream, mayonnaise, cheese, and other high-fat ingredients is a drawback for those seeking a healthy diet. Evelyn Raab's <i>Clueless in the Kitchen</i> (Firefly, 1998) is a far more extensive collection of recipes that also includes more basic information about equipment, shopping, and food preparation.<i>&#x2013;Joyce Adams Burner, Hillcrest Library, Prairie Village, KS</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A little girl makes a wish on a snow globe and, in the morning, the sun rises on a winter wonderland--beckoning all outside. And what if, on this snow-filled day, families shake their busy lives and everyone goes out to play? A lyrical holiday story about wishes and community and snow--lots and lots of snow.</p><p>Kirkus Starred Review When a snowstorm blows through town, it knocks out power and sends evening commuters scurrying for the safety and warmth of home. But in the electricity-free night, one family turns the darkness into an opportunity to slow down and enjoy time together. This charming story follows the evening of an interracial family of four: a brown-skinned and dark-haired woman, little girl, and little boy and a man presenting as white with light-colored skin and light hair. They have a candlelit picnic of Chinese takeout next to a blazing fireplace and decorated Christmas tree. The family enjoys the rest of the quiet snowy evening beneath a blanket fort in which they sleep together, cat and dog bundled in as well. The next morning, they and the rest of the community go out to play in the snow. The final spread in the book depicts the family's cat and dog looking at the happy human tableau, now within the snow globe, which reads "Peace on Earth." The muted colors, simple, childlike renderings, and happy characters make this book about a snowstorm feel warm and cozy think hygge in picture-book form. Aside from the star-topped, decorated tree and the "Peace on Earth" message, often associated with Christmas, there are no religious symbols used in the book.The feelings of community and togetherness are palpable. --Kirkus Reviews<br><br>Gentle rhyming text and na�f illustrations dominated by lovely pale yellow and teal tones are impeccably paired in this heartwarming book....Dealey and Shorrock create a winsome, hopeful portrait of family and community bonds. --Publisher's Weekly<br><br>The end of the story captures the beauty of a community coming together to celebrate the winter wonderland. The lyrical rhyming scheme of the text draws readers into the beauty of the story and captures the essence of childhood dreams. The illustrations by Claire Shorrock are filled with soft colors and exquisite detail. I love anything that Erin Dealey writes and this story is no exception. A perfect read-aloud to share during the winter season. --Picture Books 4 Learning blog</p><h2>Murakami 2020 Diary</h2><p>A beautifully designed hardback diary for 2020, featuring unique artwork inspired by Haruki Murakami's works along with quotations and significant dates. Murakami's distinctive blend of the mysterious and the everyday, of melancholy and humour, continues to enchant readers, ensuring his place as one of the world&#x2019;s most acclaimed and well-loved writers.

One April day, the impulse to write a novel came to him suddenly while watching a baseball game. That first novel, <i>Hear the Wind Sing</i>, won a new writers&#x2019; award and was published the following year. More followed, including<i> A Wild Sheep Chase</i> and <i>HardBoiled Wonderland and the End of the World</i>, but it was <i>Norwegian Wood</i>, published in 1987, which turned Murakami from a writer into a phenomenon. His books became bestsellers, were translated into many languages, including English, and the door was thrown wide open to Murakami&#x2019;s unique and addictive fictional universe. Murakami writes with admirable discipline, producing ten pages a day, after which he runs ten kilometres (he began long-distance running in 1982 and has participated in numerous marathons and races), works on translations, and then reads, listens to records and cooks. His passions colour his non-fiction output, from <i>What I Talk About When I Talk About Running</i> to <i>Absolutely On Music</i>, and they also seep into his novels and short stories, providing quotidian moments in his otherwise freewheeling flights of imaginative inquiry. In works such as<i> The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</i>,<i> 1Q84</i> and <i>Men Without Women</i>, his distinctive blend of the mysterious and the everyday, of melancholy and humour, continues to enchant readers, ensuring Murakami&#x2019;s place as one of the world&#x2019;s most acclaimed and well-loved writers.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Loyola Kids Book of Catholic Signs &amp; Symbols: An Illustrated Guide to Their History and Meaning</h2><p><b>2019 Illumination Book Awards, God in Education</b><br><br> Understand faith in the symbols that surround us.<br><br> For centuries people learned about the Christian faith through paintings, sculptures, objects, and gestures.

G. Wells. It first appeared in serialized form in 1897, published simultaneously in Pearson&#39;s Magazine in the UK and Cosmopolitan magazine in the US. The first appearance in book form was published by William Heinemann of London in 1898. It is the first-person narrative of an unnamed protagonist in Surrey and that of his younger brother in London as Earth is invaded by Martians. Written between 1895 and 1897, it is one of the earliest stories that detail a conflict between mankind and an extraterrestrial race. The novel is one of the most commented-on works in the science fiction canon. The War of the Worlds has two parts, Book One: The Coming of the Martians and Book Two: The Earth under the Martians. The narrator, a philosophically inclined author, struggles to return to his wife while seeing the Martians lay waste to the southern country outside London. Book One also imparts the experience of his brother, also unnamed, who describes events as they deteriorate in the capital, forcing him to escape the Martian onslaught by boarding a paddle steamer near Tillingham, on the Essex coast.</p><p>Join actors from Star Trek and Star Trek: The Next Generation as they recreate this classic radio thriller. The breathless pace and convincing details make it clear why the 1938 broadcast of an "eyewitness report" of an invasion from Mars caused a nationwide panic. Originally directed by Orson Welles and performed by his Mercury Theatre of the Air, The War of the Worlds is an adaptation of H. G. Wells' novel of the same name. <p> The War of the Worlds is truly the mother of all space invasions, offering a rare combination of chills, thrills and great literature. </p><p> An L.A. Theatre Works full-cast performance featuring John de Lancie, Meagan Fay, Jerry Hardin, Gates McFadden, Leonard Nimoy, Daryl Schultz, Armin Shimerman, Brent Spiner, Tom Virtue and Wil Wheaton. </p><p> The War of the Worlds is part of L.A. Theatre Works' Relativity Series featuring science-themed plays. Major funding for the Relativity Series is provided by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to enhance public understanding of science and technology in the modern world.</p>Often called the father of science fiction, British author Herbert George (H. G.) Wells literary works are notable for being some of the first titles of the science fiction genre, and include such famed titles as The Time Machine, The War of the Worlds, The Island of Doctor Moreau, and The Invisible Man. Despite being fixedly associated with science fiction, Wells wrote extensively in other genres and on many subjects, including history, society and politics, and was heavily influenced by Darwinism. His first book, Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical and Scientific Progress Upon Human Life and Thought, offered predictions about what technology and society would look like in the year 2000, many of which have proven accurate. Wells went on to pen over fifty novels, numerous non-fiction books, and dozens of short stories. His legacy has had an overwhelming influence on science fiction, popular culture, and even on technological and scientific innovation. Wells died in 1946 at the age of 79.</p><h2>Chicken Soup for the Nurse&#39;s Soul: Stories to Celebrate, Honor and Inspire the Nursing Profession (Chicken Soup for the Soul)</h2><p>You'll laugh and cry along with these stories from all types of nurses - about the patients who affected them most deeply, their personal ups and downs as nurses, their funniest moments, their most heartwarming experiences, and lots of great tips that will help you make a difference in the lives of patients and their families. &nbsp;</p><p>Jack Canfield&nbsp;is co-creator of the&nbsp;Chicken Soup&nbsp;for the Soul� series, which includes&nbsp;forty&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestsellers, and coauthor of <i>The Success Principles: How to Get from Where You Are to Where You Want to Be</i>.

Occasionally we lacked supplies or equipment and sometimes the food was less than desirable. The biggest problem was the lack of qualified help. Still, everyone working there had a genuine love for the patients, and did their best to care for them.</p> <p>Alice, a tiny, alert elderly lady with bright blue, twinkling eyes was everyone's favorite. Her only living relative was her son Jack, a large, tough man. Tattoos covered his arms and a scraggly beard grew haphazardly on his chin. No matter how cold the weather was, he always wore a tank top shirt so the dragon and snake artwork could be admired by all. He wore faded jeans, so stiff with grime, they could have stood alone. His loud and gruff manner terrified most of the staff.</p> <p>But this monstrous man loved his tiny mother. Everyday, he roared up to the hospital entrance on his old motorcycle, flung open the front door, and tromped down the hall to her room, his clacking boot heels loudly announcing his arrival. He visited at unpredictable hours so he could surprise anyone he suspected of not taking proper care of his mother. Yet, his gentleness with her amazed me.</p> <p>I made friends with Jack, figuring I'd rather be a friend with a man like him, than an enemy. And I, like everyone else, truly loved his mother. </p> <p>One particularly bad evening at the hospital, three aides called in sick, the food carts were late and cold, and one of the patients fell and broke his hip. Jack came in at suppertime, as usual, to help his mother with her meal. He stood gawking at me in the nurses' station as I busily tried to do the work of three nurses. Overwhelmed, and near tears, I avoided his stare.</p> <p>After the patients were finally fed, bathed, and put to bed I sat at the desk and put my head down on my arms for a few moment's relaxation before the night shift arrived. Suddenly, the front door burst open. Startled, I thought, Oh no! Here comes Jack, checking up on us again! As he stomped to the desk, I looked up to see his burly hand gripping a pickle jar with a bit of colored yarn tied in a bow around the neck. And in the jar was the loveliest, long stemmed red rose I'd ever seen. Jack handed it to me and said, "I noticed what a bad time you were having tonight. This is for you, from me and my mother."</p> <p>With that, he turned around, marched back out the door, and with a roar from his motorcycle, rode out into the darkness. I've received many gifts and cards from many grateful patients and their families, but never one that touched me more than the red rose in the pickle jar given to me that night so long ago.</p> <b>Kathryn Kimzey Judkins</b><br> <p>�2001.

Lucas envisioned a swashbuckling SF saga inspired by the Flash Gordon serials classic American westerns, the epic cinema of Japanese auteur Akira Kurosawa, and mythological heroes. Its original title: The Star Wars. The rest is history, and how it was made is a story as entertaining and exciting as the movie that has enthralled millions for thirty years&#x2013;a story that has never been told as it was meant to be. Until now.<br><br> Using his unprecedented access to the Lucasfilm Archives and its trove of never-before-published &#x201c;lost&#x201d; interviews, photos, production notes, factoids, and anecdotes, Star Wars scholar J. W. Rinzler hurtles readers back in time for a one-of-a-kind behind-the-scenes look at the nearly decade-long quest of George Lucas and his key collaborators to make the &#x201c;little&#x201d; movie that became a phenomenon. For the first time, it&#x2019;s all here:<br><br> � the evolution of the now-classic story and characters&#x2013;including &#x201c;Annikin Starkiller&#x201d; and &#x201c;a huge green-skinned monster with no nose and large gills&#x201d; named Han Solo<br> � excerpts from George Lucas&#x2019;s numerous, ever-morphing script drafts<br> � the birth of Industrial Light &amp; Magic, the special-effects company that revolutionized Hollywood filmmaking<br> � the studio-hopping and budget battles that nearly scuttled the entire project<br> � the director&#x2019;s early casting saga, which might have led to a film spoken mostly in Japanese&#x2013;including the intensive auditions that won the cast members their roles and made them legends <br> � the grueling, nearly catastrophic location shoot in Tunisia and the subsequent breakneck dash at Elstree Studios in London<br> � the who&#x2019;s who of young film rebels who pitched in to help&#x2013;including Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg, and Brian DePalma<br><br> But perhaps most exciting, and rarest of all, are the interviews conducted before and during production and immediately after the release of Star Wars&#x2013;in which George Lucas, Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Sir Alec Guinness, Anthony Daniels, composer John Williams, effects masters Dennis Muren, Richard Edlund, and John Dykstra, Phil Tippett, Rick Baker, legendary production designer John Barry, and a host of others share their fascinating tales from the trenches and candid opinions of the film that would ultimately change their lives. <br><br> No matter how you view the spectrum of this thirty-year phenomenon, The Making of Star Wars stands as a crucial document&#x2013;rich in fascination and revelation&#x2013;of a genuine cinematic and cultural touchstone.</p><p>J.

His father, Erik the Red, had established the first European settlement in present-day Greenland, and although he didn't yet know it, Leif was destined to embark on an adventure of his own. The wise and striking Viking landed in the area known as Vinland almost five centuries before Christopher Columbus even set sail! "Leif the Lucky" and the other fierce, sea-fearing pirates were accomplished navigators who raided foreign lands for resources, hunted for their food, and passed down Old Norse myths from one generation to the next. This book gives readers a detailed account of what life was like during the time of the Vikings.</p><p>Nico Medina is the author of several Who HQ books, including<i> Where Is Mount Everest</i>?, <i>Where Is Alcatraz</i>?, <i>Who Is Aretha Franklin?</i>, and <i>What Was the Ice Age?</i><br><br>Dede Putra is an illustrator who currently resides in Auckland, New Zealand. He has strong skills in art and years of experience in book illustrations, video game development, film making and fashion.<b>Who Was Leif Erikson?</b><br><br>&nbsp;<br> Leif Erikson (say: LEEF AY-rick-sun) was only around twenty years old. But he had already accomplished quite a bit in his young life. And now, in the year 1000, he was sailing across the stormy North Atlantic Ocean from his home in Greenland to visit the king of Norway. It was a journey of several days. When Leif arrived in Norway, King Olaf was happy to meet him.<br> &nbsp;<br> During their visit, Olaf and Leif talked about a friend of Leif&#x2019;s, Bjarni Herj�lfsson (say: bih-YAR-nee hair-YOLF-sun). Bjarni had visited with King Olaf a couple of years earlier and had told him a story Leif knew well, about a mysterious land that lay west of Greenland.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bjarni had spotted this heavily forested land on an earlier sea voyage. He had been sailing to Greenland but became lost when his ship was blown off course. An unfamiliar coast came into view. Bjarni&#x2019;s crew asked if they could go ashore to explore, but Bjarni was too cautious. He didn&#x2019;t want to put the crew in any danger. He refused.<br> &nbsp;<br> King Olaf and his friends told Bjarni that he should have listened to his crew! And they now told Leif that they thought Bjarni had missed a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.<br> &nbsp;<br> Leif wondered: Could there <i>really</i> be an unknown and unexplored land west of Greenland?<br> &nbsp;<br> The folk stories of Norse mythology, the original religion of his youth, had taught Leif that the world he lived in was flat. He believed that the border of this flat area was encircled by a terrible snake-monster. And if you sailed too far from home, you might come face-to-face with it&#x2014;and meet a terrifying end!<br> &nbsp;<br> But maybe there was more to the world than his mythology had taught him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Leif was determined to return to Greenland and attempt to do what Bjarni hadn&#x2019;t: explore this mysterious New World. Just as his father, Erik the Red, had done in Greenland, Leif wanted to build a Viking settlement where no one had dared to before.<br> &nbsp;<br> Leif Erikson would soon become the first European to set foot on North America&#x2014;more than four hundred years before Christopher Columbus was even born!<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1:&nbsp;Erik&#x2019;s Son</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Leif Erikson was born in Iceland around the year 980. His last name, Erikson (or &#x201c;Erik&#x2019;s son&#x201d;), came from his father, Erik Thorvaldsson, called Erik the Red. Like many Vikings before him, Leif was born into a life of exploration and adventure.<br> &nbsp;<br> Erik the Red had grown up in Norway, nine hundred miles away from Iceland. He got his name from his fiery red hair and beard&#x2014;and his violent temper.<br> &nbsp;<br> When Erik the Red was about ten years old, his father, Leif&#x2019;s grandfather, committed a murder. The king of Norway banished Erik and his father&#x2014;he forced them to leave the country.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Viking kings, like the king of Norway, were very powerful men. Their history began with King Harald about one hundred years earlier.<br> &nbsp;<br> Erik the Red and his father left Norway and sailed to their new home: Iceland. Erik grew up and eventually purchased a sheep farm and married his wife, Thjodhild (say: JODE-hiled). They had three sons, Thorvald, Leif, and Thorstein. Leif also had a sister named Freydis. Erik and Thjodhild&#x2019;s children belonged to a typical Viking family.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Vikings were fierce warriors and sailors from Norway, Denmark, and Sweden&#x2014;the lands together known as Scandinavia. Since the late 700s, whenever summer rolled around, the Vikings left their homes in Scandinavia seeking adventure, glory, and treasure in lands across Europe. They were pirates who took what they wanted from the people they conquered, including other people whom they used as slaves. Many Vikings settled in the new lands they attacked, from England to Ireland to Iceland&#x2014;and as far away as Greenland.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> In the summers, Erik the Red and his men sailed away in search of villages to threaten. In these violent and deadly raids, Erik and his fellow Viking warriors burned villages to the ground and stole anything of value. The Vikings had been doing this for hundreds of years, all around Europe. Villagers who weren&#x2019;t killed might be taken as slaves.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Erik the Red owned slaves in Iceland. One day, the slaves caused a rockslide, which damaged Erik&#x2019;s neighbor&#x2019;s house. It was an accident, but the neighbor reacted violently, by killing Erik&#x2019;s slaves.<br> &nbsp;<br> Erik responded with a violent attack of his own: by killing his neighbor&#x2014;and his neighbor&#x2019;s cousin!<br> &nbsp;<br> Charges were brought against Erik at the Thing.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Thing reached its decision: Erik the Red was declared an outlaw. Like his father before him in Norway, Erik was banished. He would have to leave Iceland immediately. Even worse, Erik&#x2019;s fellow Icelanders were allowed to kill him if he didn&#x2019;t hurry up!<br> &nbsp;<br> Luckily, Erik had a few friends left in Iceland. They helped hide him while he prepared his family, his ship, and his crew to set sail. But where would he go?<br> &nbsp;<br> He could never return to Norway. Nor to Ireland or England, which had become crowded with too many other Viking settlers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Erik decided to sail west for five stormy days, to a place where he could build a new life for himself, his family, and his friends. A place where no other Vikings lived. A place where Erik would answer to no one but himself.</p><h2>Smithsonian Kids: Digging for Dinosaurs (Deluxe Multi Activity Book)</h2><p><p> <strong>Preschoolers</strong> will learn fun facts in this <em>Smithsonian Kids</em> book about dinosaurs, pterosaurs, fossils, and sea reptiles<em>.</em> This <strong>interactive board book</strong> is sturdy enough for the most enthusiastic little explorer, with features such as a <strong>pronunciation guide</strong>, sliding tabs, spinner wheels, and lift-a-flaps to build fine motor skills. <strong>Beautiful illustrations</strong> with <strong>real-life photos</strong> bring dinosaurs to life.

He lives in Brooklyn, New York.PreSchool-Grade 2-- Possum tracks on the end papers lead directly to a pink-eyed, long-tailed possum in top hat and vest, energetically knocking on the door to a house. The indoor activities of the family members are viewed through a window and described in a rhyming, rhythmic, erratically cumulative text. "Possum come a-knockin' at the door, at the door. Possum come a-knockin' at the door," says the girl who narrates. When the child finally convinces everyone to look outside, Possum hides behind a tree; they've all been tricked, and one suspects it may all happen again. Booth's trademark swinging lightbulb and demented dog and cat are here, but they're toned down a bit for the audience, and the addition of watercolor seems to have a calming influence as well. There are some problems: the family activities are stereotyped (Pa is hammering, Pappy's whittling, Ma is cooking, Granny's knitting); there may be objections to the use of mountain dialect, and there is an occasional weakness in the text. But children will relish the nonsense of it all and will soon be chanting along. --Leda Schubert, Vermont Department of Education, Montpelier<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Matilda: Broadway Tie-In</h2><p><b>Now a musical!&nbsp;</b><br><br> Matilda is a sweet, exceptional young girl, but her parents think she's just a nuisance. She expects school to be different but there she has to face Miss Trunchbull, a menacing, kid-hating headmistress. When Matilda is attacked by the Trunchbull she suddenly discovers she has a remarkable power with which to fight back. It'll take a superhuman genius to give Miss Trunchbull what she deserves and Matilda may be just the one to do it!<br><br> Here is Roald Dahl's original novel of a little girl with extraordinary powers. This much-loved story has recently been made into a wonderful new musical, adapted by Dennis Kelly with music and lyrics by Tim Minchin.</p><p>Matilda is a little girl who is far too good to be true. At age five-and-a-half she's knocking off double-digit multiplication problems and blitz-reading Dickens. Even more remarkably, her classmates love her even though she's a super-nerd and the teacher's pet. But everything is not perfect in Matilda's world. For starters she has two of the most idiotic, self-centered parents who ever lived. Then there's the large, busty nightmare of a school principal, Mrs. ("The") Trunchbull, a former hammer-throwing champion who flings children at will and is approximately as sympathetic as a bulldozer. Fortunately for Matilda, she has the inner resources to deal with such annoyances: astonishing intelligence, saintly patience, and an innate predilection for revenge.<p> She warms up with some practical jokes aimed at her hapless parents, but the true test comes when she rallies in defense of her teacher, the sweet Miss Honey, against the diabolical Trunchbull. There is never any doubt that Matilda will carry the day. Even so, this wonderful story is far from predictable--the big surprise comes when Matilda discovers a new, mysterious facet of her mental dexterity. Roald Dahl, while keeping the plot moving imaginatively, also has an unerring ear for emotional truth. The reader cares about Matilda because in addition to all her other gifts, she has real feelings. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i></p><b>Roald Dahl</b>&nbsp;(1916-1990) was born in Wales of Norwegian parents.

She reflected on all she had learned through becoming a single parent, looking for love in all the wrong places, working on her relationship with God, battling cancer and making peace with a difficult childhood. It became one of the most popular columns ever published in the newspaper, and since then the 50 lessons have been emailed to hundreds of thousands of people.<br>Brett now takes the 50 lessons and expounds on them in essays that are deeply personal. From "Don't take yourself too seriously-Nobody else does" to "Life isn't tied with a bow, but it's still a gift," these lessons will strike a chord with anyone who has ever gone through tough times--and haven't we all?</p><p>Regina Brett has been a newspaper columnist for fourteen years, eight of them for Cleveland's<em> Plain Dealer</em>, where she was a finalist in 2008 and 2009 for the Pulitzer Prize in Commentary. She also hosts her own call-in talk show once a week on WKSU, Northeast Ohio's NPR affiliate, and speaks regularly to companies and not-for-profit organizations.On turning 50, Cleveland Plain Dealer columnist Brett wrote her most popular piece ever, containing the cancer survivor and single mom's most important life lessons. Here she expands and expounds on that column, incorporating other essays penned over her 14 years as an opinion columnist, to make a rousing inspirational collection. Most of her pieces-dedicated to substantive but familiar ideas like "Overprepare, then go with the flow," "Stay put in the day you are in," and "God loves you because of who God is"-are short, sweet, and frequently resonant (if at times overly simple). Complimenting her own experience with anecdotes from friends and others, as well as poems, prayers, psalms and excerpts from treasured books, Brett employs a veteran writer's knack for keen observation and thorough self-knowledge, delivering hard-earned wisdom with deceptive ease. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

First, it&#39;s for college students, graduate students, and even high school students - good writing is good writing; all that changes is the length and complexity of what you write. But the plan stays the same. Second, I&#39;m not going to tell you any cute stories about writing. I&#39;m not going to tell you the standard information about writing. Nor am I going to give you a simple formula for writing an essay. They don&#39;t work, and in the long run, they won&#39;t help you. What I am going to do is give you a plan for how you should approach writing essays. This plan works. If you follow it and practice it, you will learn to write much better essays - all types of essays. Because all essays are essentially the same. Most teachers and books will tell you differently. But I think they are wrong. The rules for good writing don&#39;t change depending on a certain &#34;type&#34; of essay. The only thing that changes is how you make your case, how you make your argument (and we cover that in Step 5). In this plan, we&#39;re not going to cover every aspect of academic writing. We&#39;re going to focus on the things that you absolutely have to do in order to create good essays. How do I know all of this? I&#39;ve been teaching since 1996. I&#39;ve taught at every level of schooling, and I&#39;ve taught students from around the world. Now I work as an associate professor at The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley where I teach people how to teach. I also publish my own academic writing in some of the top journals in my field (you can look up my work on Google Scholar). So, not only do I know what students need to learn to create great essays, I put this information to the test in my own academic work. And in this book, I boil down all of my experience teaching writing plus my experience as a scholar into a simple, direct, and efficient plan that will improve the quality of your essays.</p><p></p><h2>When</h2><p>Maddie doesn't have a choice. The forehead of every person she sees is marked by the shadowy digits of their deathdate. Her unique, innate skill often feels more like a curse than a gift, and Maddie grudgingly puts it to use identifying deathdates for the paying customers her mother reels in. It seems like a straightforward way to help support her family-until one client's young son goes missing on the exact date Maddie has pinpointed, and she gets pulled into a homicide investigation that turns her world upside down. <br><br>As more young people disappear and are later found murdered, suspicion swirls around Maddie. At once a suspect in the investigation, a target for the murderer, and a partner in a tantalizing dance with a boy who might be connected to it all, could Maddie also hold the key to cracking the case? <br><br>This perfectly plotted high-stakes, fast-paced thriller marks <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author Victoria Laurie's YA debut and brims with depth, heart, action, and romance. <br><strong></strong> <strong>Praise for </strong><em><strong>When</strong> </em> "Laurie's debut for teens is quite an accomplishment...The character development is just as riveting as the plot in this well-constructed thriller."<br> -<em>Kirkus Reviews</em><br><br>"The novel packs in plenty of fast-paced, nail-biting fun, perfect for fans of Barnes' The Naturals series."<br> -<em>Bulletin for the Center of Children's Books</em><br><br>"This excellent book is a must-have for all libraries, especially where suspense and teen-life fiction is hot.

After suffering the tragic loss of her father at a young age, Maddie and her mother eke out an existence in suburban New Jersey with Maddie doing "readings" for clients to supplement their income.

But Cullen was neither a mercy killer nor a simple monster. He was a son, a husband, a father, a best friend, and a valued caregiver. He was also implicated in the deaths of as many as 400 people, and may be the most prolific serial killer in American history.<br><br>Cullen's career in the world's most trusted profession spanned sixteen years, across nine hospitals. In this riveting work of investigative journalism, Charles Graeber-the only person Cullen chose to speak with following his arrest-reveals how Cullen got away with murder for so long. Based on hundreds of hours of previously unseen and unheard footage, recordings, and records, as well as extensive interviews with homicide detectives, Cullen's friends, family, coworkers, and confidential informants and whistleblowers, plus exclusive, one-on-one interviews with Cullen, himself, THE GOOD NURSE paints a dramatic portrait of madness and the bounds of friendship, and shines a spotlight on America's medical system.

After her mother is killed in a car accident on the way home from the airport, Juliet, an AP English student, continues the practice&#x2014;a coping strategy that her friends and counselors are beginning to question. Declan is an auto shop student who has been court-ordered to clean the cemetery as community service after a drunk-driving incident, and he discovers one of Juliet's letters. He decides to answer it, starting an exchange reminiscent of that in the film You've Got Mail or, more recently, Becky Albertalli's novel Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda. As the letter writing (and then emailing, chatting, and texting) continues, through pseudonyms, Juliet and Declan learn that they have much in common, but day-to-day life is another story. When they cross paths in both school and the community, their interactions are hostile, a commentary on the way students of different circles and academic levels sometimes view one another. Eventually, though, their facades unravel, and their identities are revealed. Readers will find themselves rooting for the real Declan to win Juliet's heart the same way his online persona did.

The coordinated focus of these materials is unique: biblical content, provocative questions, systematic theology, practical application, and the gospel story of God&#x2019;s grace presented all the way through Scripture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Philip Graham Ryken,</strong> President, Wheaton College</p><p>&#x201c;These <em>Knowing the Bible</em> volumes introduce a significant and very welcome variation on the general run of inductive Bible studies. Such series often provide questions with little guidance, leaving students to their own devices. They thus tend to overlook the role of teaching in the church. By contrast, Knowing the Bible avoids the problem by providing substantial instruction with the questions. Knowing the Bible then goes even further by showing how any given passage connects with the gospel, the whole Bible, and Christian theology. I heartily endorse this orientation of individual books to the whole Bible and the gospel, and I applaud the demonstration that sound theology was not something invented later by Christians, but is right there in the pages of Scripture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Graeme Goldsworthy,</strong>&nbsp;Former Lecturer in Old Testament, Biblical Theology, and Hermeneutics, Moore Theological College</p><p>&#x201c;What a gift to earnest, Bible-loving, Bible-searching believers! The organization and structure of the Bible study format presented through the <em>Knowing the Bible</em> series is so well conceived. Students of the Word are led to understand the content of passages through perceptive, guided questions, and they are given rich insights and application all along the way in the brief but illuminating sections that conclude each study. What potential growth in depth and breadth of understanding these studies offer. One can only pray that vast numbers of believers will discover more of God and the beauty of his Word through these rich studies.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Bruce A. Ware,</strong>&nbsp;T.

This book provides keys to making these programs more effective, seamless, efficient, and sustainable by combining them into a single multi-tiered system of support (MTSS). Steps and strategies are outlined for integrating data structures, practices, teams, and district systems. Contributing authors present detailed case examples of successful MTSS implementation in three states. In a large-size format with lay-flat binding, the book features 27 reproducible checklists and evaluation tools. Purchasers get access to a companion website where they can download and print the reproducible materials plus other helpful resources.<br><br> This book is in The Guilford Practical Intervention in the Schools Series, edited by T.

This book does a superb job of addressing the 'why,' 'what,' 'how,' 'when,' and 'where' of aligning and integrating leadership teaming, data-based decision making, explicit academic and behavior instruction, universal screening, continuous progress monitoring, and evaluation and coaching. And, it provides the empirical support, self-assessments, and applied examples for making MTSS contextually relevant and doable for you and your students."--George Sugai, PhD, Professor and Carole J.

They clearly articulate the critical features and attributes that support implementation and sustainability of an MTSS at both the district and building levels. The authors have succeeded in writing a very reader-friendly book, complete with practical examples and tools for moving teams at all stages of implementation forward. This is an essential practitioner&#x2019;s handbook and should be required reading for all preservice educators."--Dawn Miller, PhD, SWIFT Center (Schoolwide Integrated Framework for Transformation), University of Kansas<br><br> "At a time when educational systems are under constant financial strain, the ability to integrate systems in school districts is crucial. By using an MTSS, K&#x2013;12 educators can become more efficient and effective. This book details how to work toward integrating current processes and support systems to facilitate student learning. I encourage school personnel who want to understand an integrated approach to educational systems to read this book."--Gustavo Balderas, DEd, Superintendent of Schools, Eugene School District, Oregon<br><br> "Well written, understandable, informative, and relevant. McIntosh and Goodman have created a great resource that is useful for those just embarking on an MTSS journey as well as those who have been working toward an integrated MTSS for some time. Not only does this book provide guidance about how and why integration of academic RTI and PBIS is important, but it also gives us tools to help us all in our work."--Justyn Poulos,&nbsp;Assistant Director, Wisconsin RTI Center<br></p><h2>Mindset Mathematics: Visualizing and Investigating Big Ideas, Grade 6</h2><p><p><b>Engage students in mathematics using growth mindset techniques</b></p> <p>The most challenging parts of teaching mathematics are engaging students and helping them understand the connections between mathematics concepts. In this volume, you'll find a collection of low floor, high ceiling tasks that will help you do just that, by looking at the big ideas at the sixth-grade level through visualization, play, and investigation.</p> <p>During their work with tens of thousands of teachers, authors Jo Boaler, Jen Munson, and Cathy Williams heard the same message&#x2015;that they want to incorporate more brain science into their math instruction, but they need guidance in the techniques that work best to get across the concepts they needed to teach. So the authors designed Mindset Mathematics around the principle of active student engagement, with tasks that reflect the latest brain science on learning. Open, creative, and visual math tasks have been shown to improve student test scores, and more importantly change their relationship with mathematics and start believing in their own potential. The tasks in Mindset Mathematics reflect the lessons from brain science that:</p> <ul> <li>There is no such thing as a math person - anyone can learn mathematics to high levels.</li> <li>Mistakes, struggle and challenge are the most important times for brain growth.</li> <li>Speed is unimportant in mathematics.</li> <li>Mathematics is a visual and beautiful subject, and our brains want to think visually about mathematics.</li> </ul> <p>With engaging questions, open-ended tasks, and four-color visuals that will help kids get excited about mathematics, Mindset Mathematics is organized around nine big ideas which emphasize the connections within the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and can be used with any current curriculum.</p></p><p><p><b>Engage Your Students in Visual, Creative Explorations of the Big Ideas in Mathematics</b> </p><p>The <i>Mindset Mathematics</i> series offers a unique, research-based visual approach to exploring the big ideas in mathematics, which is essential to future mathematics success. This hands-on resource is for any teacher who wants to engage their sixth grade students in reasoning and persisting through problems, and provides activities that will engage students' interest and show them the many ways that mathematics is important in their lives. </p><p>During their work with tens of thousands of teachers, authors Jo Boaler, Jen Munson, and Cathy Williams heard the same message: Teachers want to incorporate more brain science into their mathematics instruction, but they need guidance in the techniques that work best to promote learning of mathematics concepts.

LeGuin gets a beautiful new repackage.</b><br><br>In this second novel in the Earthsea series, Tenar is chosen as high priestess to the ancient and nameless Powers of the Earth, and everything is taken from her&#x2014;home, family, possessions, even her name. She is now known only as Arha, the Eaten One, and guards the shadowy, labyrinthine Tombs of Atuan.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then a wizard, Ged Sparrowhawk, comes to steal the Tombs&#x2019; greatest hidden treasure, the Ring of Erreth-Akbe. Tenar&#x2019;s duty is to protect the Ring, but Ged possesses the light of magic and tales of a world that Tenar has never known. Will Tenar risk everything to escape from the darkness that has become her domain?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With millions of copies sold worldwide, Ursula K. Le Guin&#x2019;s Earthsea Cycle has earned a treasured place on the shelves of fantasy lovers everywhere, alongside the works of such beloved authors as J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis. Now the full Earthsea collection&#x2014;<i>A Wizard of Earthsea</i>, <i>The Tombs of Atuan</i>, <i>The Farthest Shore</i>, <i>Tehanu</i>, <i>Tales from Earthsea</i>, and <i>The Other Wind</i>&#x2014;is available with a fresh, modern look that will endear it both to loyal fans and new legions of readers.</p><p>Often compared to Tolkien's Middle-earth or Lewis's Narnia, Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea is a stunning fantasy world that grabs quickly at our hearts, pulling us deeply into its imaginary realms. Four books (<i>A Wizard of Earthsea</i>, <i>The Tombs of Atuan</i>, <i>The Farthest Shore</i>, and <i>Tehanu</i>) tell the whole Earthsea cycle--a tale about a reckless, awkward boy named Sparrowhawk who becomes a wizard's apprentice after the wizard reveals Sparrowhawk's true name. The boy comes to realize that his fate may be far more important than he ever dreamed possible. Le Guin challenges her readers to think about the power of language, how in the act of naming the world around us we actually create that world. Teens, especially, will be inspired by the way Le Guin allows her characters to evolve and grow into their own powers. <p> In this second book of Le Guin's Earthsea series, readers will meet Tenar, a priestess to the "Nameless Ones" who guard the catacombs of the Tombs of Atuan. Only Tenar knows the passageways of this dark labyrinth, and only <b>she</b> can lead the young wizard Sparrowhawk, who stumbles into its maze, to the greatest treasure of all. Will she?</p>Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea cycle has become one of the best-loved fantasies of our time. The windswept world of Earthsea is one of the greatest creations in all fantasy literature, frequently compared with J.R.R. Tolkien's <i>Middle Earth</i> or C.S. Lewis'<i>Narnia</i>. The magnificent saga begins with <i>A Wizard Of Earthsea</i>, continues in <i>The Tombs Of Atuan</i> and <i>The Farthest Shore</i>, and concludes with <i>Tehanu</i> --each book a treasure of wisdom, wonder, and literary wizardry. When she was still a child, Tenar was stripped of her name and family and dedicated as high priestess to the Nameless Ones, dark powers of <i>The Tombs of Atuan</i>. This is the tale of the young wizard, Ged, who came to the forbidden labyrinth to steal its greatest treasure--the Ring of Erreth-Akbe--and stayed to set Tenar free and lead her out of darkness.</p><h2>The Sexual Healing Journey: A Guide for Survivors of Sexual Abuse, 3rd Edition</h2><p><p>&#x201c;This classic self-help book offers sound and detailed guidelines for sexual healing.

This gorgeous picture book, published by the National Geographic Society, introduces children to the constellations that are named for animals--Leo the Lion, the Great Bear and Little Bear, and many more. Christina Balit's striking paintings showcase each constellation against a deep blue background--animals or fantastical beasts positioned in the dark night sky, with the individual stars, metallic and iridescent, superimposed upon them. Each image is accompanied by a short, engaging, often dramatized description of the group of stars and the legends surrounding it, written by distinguished astronomer and writer Dr. Jacqueline Mitton: "Charging through the zodiac, here comes the Bull. Head down, horns thrust forward, Taurus is ready to toss the twins. But they are safe, always on the other side of the Milky Way." The front and endpapers are star maps that show the actual constellations of both the southern and northern skies. Mitton also offers a brief introduction to the constellations and two pages of related discussion on astronomy at the book's end. A lovely choice for anyone interested in the mysteries of the night sky. (Click to see a sample spread. Text � 1998 Jacqueline Mitton. Illustrations � 1998 Christina Balit.)

In between, she enumerates some of the areas of study&#x2013;astronomy, geology, paleontology, oceanography, botany, meteorology, and zoology. Each page has just a few words, in large print, superimposed on a background of boldly colored acrylic, pastel, and collage art. The rhyming text flows nicely, but because some spreads contain only sentence fragments, a quick read-through is necessary to get the full effect of the rhyme and cadence. Pleasingly rounded shapes dominate the paintings, which feature stylized boys and girls of various ethnicities, surrounded by plants and animals, as they observe nature and use books in their research. Many children are attracted to science, but few youngsters realize all that the word encompasses. Although this book leaves out important categories, such as chemistry and mathematics, it does introduce a wide range of subjects.

A failed salesman turned local reporter, he wanted to test himself, see how he might respond to pressure and danger. He signed up for emergency medical training and became, at age twenty-six, a newly minted EMT running calls in the worst sections of Atlanta. His life entered a different realm&#x2014;one of blood, violence, and amazing grace.<br> <br> Thoroughly intimidated at first and frequently terrified, he experienced on a nightly basis the adrenaline rush of walking into chaos. But in his downtime, Kevin reflected on how people&#x2019;s facades drop away when catastrophe strikes. As his hours on the job piled up, he realized he was beginning to see into the truth of things. There is no pretense five beats into a chest compression, or in an alley next to a crack den, or on a dimly lit highway where cars have collided. Eventually, what had at first seemed impossible happened: Kevin acquired mastery. And in the process he was able to discern the professional differences between his freewheeling peers, what marked each&#x2014;as he termed them&#x2014;as &#x201c;a tourist,&#x201d; &#x201c;true believer,&#x201d; or &#x201c;killer.&#x201d;<br> <br> Combining indelible scenes that remind us of life&#x2019;s fragile beauty with laugh-out-loud moments that keep us smiling through the worst, <i>A Thousand Naked Strangers </i>is an absorbing read about one man&#x2019;s journey of self-discovery&#x2014;a trip that also teaches us about ourselves.</p><p>Kevin Hazzard worked as a paramedic from 2004 to 2013, primarily at Grady Hospital in Atlanta.

He and his family live in Hermosa Beach, California.A Thousand Naked Strangers Prologue<p></p> <br>I did nothing to save the first person who died in front of me. I simply stood watch and let her go. She was old and white and wasting away in a nursing home. Her death was unceremonious, but fast, and I was the only witness, earth&#x2019;s final sentry, there to do nothing but close the gates as she slipped through.<br> <br>I was only twenty-six when she died, but already I&#x2019;d squandered away two lives&#x2014;the first as a failed salesman, the other as a reporter in exile. EMS was an accidental third act. It was early 2004, centuries ago. When I look back, I find it hard to believe this death and countless others happened, that at one time my sole purpose was to be present, as either anxious participant or indifferent witness. As with much of my EMS life, the memory is fuzzy: soft light filtered through gauze. It&#x2019;s only the details&#x2014;the little ones that don&#x2019;t seem to matter at the time&#x2014;that carry on. So really, what I have is more sensation than recollection, more feeling than anecdote.<br> <br>This is how it all feels to me now.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s my second night, and I&#x2019;m partnered with a guy who never goes home. He&#x2019;s a firefighter in the next county, but he&#x2019;ll do anything for money and works a handful of part-time jobs. When he isn&#x2019;t here or at the fire station, he sweats over the fryer at McDonald&#x2019;s. Just before ten, we&#x2019;re called to a nursing home for a sick woman. My partner is tired. He walks slowly, eyes to the floor, as we push the stretcher off the elevator and wander down the long corridor to the patient&#x2019;s room. We ease alongside her bed. A nurse hovers in the background, saying the woman didn&#x2019;t eat dinner, isn&#x2019;t acting like herself, and needs to be seen. I take her blood pressure, her pulse, count her breaths. Her eyes are closed; her skin&#x2014;white and crinkled like parchment paper&#x2014;is dry and hot. My partner asks for her papers. We don&#x2019;t ever leave a nursing home without papers. Most people in a nursing home can&#x2019;t talk, and those who can don&#x2019;t make sense, so even a question as straightforward as Who are you? doesn&#x2019;t yield usable results. So we get the papers, a thick manila envelope stuffed with everything from medical problems to next of kin. More important, it&#x2019;s in this packet that we&#x2019;ll find insurance information and whether or not there&#x2019;s a do-not-resuscitate order.<br> <br>Ostensibly, we&#x2019;re here for the patient, but really all we care about is the DNR.<br> <br>The DNR is the word of God Himself, written in triplicate and handed over not by Moses but by a big-boned woman in orthopedic nursing shoes. It&#x2019;s in these papers that we&#x2019;ll find answers to the uncomfortable questions that absolutely must be answered. What if she loses consciousness? What if she dies? Do I go all the way&#x2014;CPR, electric shocks, slip a tube down her throat, drill a hole in her leg for medication? Or do I watch her swirl the drain until she disappears altogether? What does her family want? What would she want? The existence of this piece of paper, even its absence, means a lot. To everyone. At the hospital, the nurses will ask about it, and the doctors won&#x2019;t look at us until we&#x2019;ve answered. At her age, in her condition, everyone will agree resuscitation, even if it could be accomplished, would be cruel. So does she have a DNR? The nurse says she does, that it&#x2019;s atop her packet, the first page in the stack. She leaves to get it.<br> <br>And that&#x2019;s when it happens. Before my partner&#x2014;who&#x2019;s leaning against the wall&#x2014;coaxes his mass into action. Before I pull back the sheet. Before anyone addresses her directly. She opens her eyes&#x2014;milky and unfocused&#x2014;and tilts her head forward. Her lips part and then, without ceremony, she relaxes. Her last breath escapes. A single tear runs down her cheek.<br> <br>I know instantly what&#x2019;s happened. But is it really that simple? That easy? The nurse has just said the patient has a DNR, so that drilled-into-my-head-during-school compulsion to act doesn&#x2019;t kick in. Instead, I spend the first few seconds staring into her vacant eyes, tracing the arc of that single tear&#x2014;her final corporeal act&#x2014;and marvel at this woman. Moments ago she was something to pity, bedridden and in a diaper. Now, plucked from her stained nightgown, she is cloaked in the wisdom of the ages. She knows why we&#x2019;re here and, more important, what&#x2019;s next. And if it&#x2019;s not the black nothingness we&#x2019;ve feared all along, then how small we must look to her now. In dying she has crossed over. Or hasn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>My partner, unaware she&#x2019;s dead, has finally come to life. He motions for me to grab the other end of the sheet so we can move her onto our stretcher. I need to tell him, let him decide what comes next, but I don&#x2019;t trust my own instincts. I&#x2019;m brand-new at this, I&#x2019;ve never watched someone die. My experience with the dead&#x2014;recent or otherwise&#x2014;is limited. If my partner doesn&#x2019;t notice, then perhaps she&#x2019;s not dead. The woman was hardly moving when we arrived and now looks no different. With a yank, we slide her over. He covers her with a sheet, buckles her in, starts pushing. I stare at her chest, her face, looking for signs of life that I know deep down I will not find. We grab her packet, and sure enough, the DNR is stapled to the top. We ride the elevator, step out into the cool night. With a sharp metallic click, the stretcher is snapped into the mount on the floor of the ambulance.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think she&#x2019;s dead,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>My partner stops and looks not at her but at me.<br> <br>I clear my throat, tell him I don&#x2019;t think she&#x2019;s breathing.<br> <br>He climbs into the ambulance, looks, feels, deflates. In the absence of the DNR, he might do something, but it&#x2019;s not absent. It&#x2019;s right there, and this document, drafted and signed with the sole intention of clarifying this woman&#x2019;s final moments, instead obscures our next move. Had she died in the nursing home, we&#x2019;d leave her, but she&#x2019;s here now. Dead on our stretcher. In our ambulance.<br> <br>We have drifted into murky water.<br> <br>He calls the nursing home. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re in the parking lot,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Your patient is dead.&#x201d; &#x201c;She&#x2019;s in your ambulance,&#x201d; the nurse tells him, &#x201c;she&#x2019;s yours now.&#x201d; I stand outside while they argue. Our patient lies in state. What to do with her? The hospital doesn&#x2019;t take dead bodies, nor does the nursing home. This woman has died and no one wants her. She is a corpse in limbo. My partner hangs up. Fumes. He goes back in to explain, to plead, to threaten. I&#x2019;m not sure why, but he leaves me in the back with her.<br> <br>I sit in the ambulance and stare into the woman&#x2019;s half-open eyes. I grab the packet and flip through. If we are to keep each other company, I should at least know her name. Her birthday. Turns out she is eighty-eight.<br> <br>There aren&#x2019;t many things you can do in the back of an ambulance with a dead woman. My cooler sits in the corner, but no. I could talk to her, but frankly, she is so recently dead, so unchanged from before, I feel as if addressing her directly will wake her. Well, not her but the ghost of her, which is worse. This may sound foolish, but I can assure you that all except the most gruesomely killed or severely decomposed look as if they&#x2019;ll sit up and begin talking at the slightest provocation.<br> <br>I decide to call home. &#x201c;Are you still awake?&#x201d; I ask my wife.<br> <br>She says she is. She broke down and started watching the latest episode of The Sopranos without me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re gonna love it.&#x201d; When I say nothing, she asks if I&#x2019;m mad, and after a second I tell her where I am. Tell her that I&#x2019;m alone with a woman I&#x2019;ve watched die and who has become, thanks to my indecision, something of a refugee.<br> <br>She asks how the woman died, and though I know this isn&#x2019;t what she means, I say, &#x201c;Peacefully.&#x201d;</p><h2>Curious George Visits the Dentist</h2><p>Curious George bites into a shiny apple made of wax and&nbsp;his tooth begins to hurt.

Could there be wolves lurking in the woods, hoping to waylay them as they return home with their bags full of goodies?

Fans of this adventuresome flock of sheep will not want to miss this Halloween treat in board book format!</p><p><p>Nancy Shaw is the author of eight beloved tales featuring the endearing and comical sheep. She came up with the idea for the sheep books during a very long car trip with her husband and two children.&nbsp;She lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan with her family. For more information, visit http://www.nancyshawbooks.com/.</p><br><br><p>Margot Apple is a freelance illustrator, having&nbsp;illustrated more than fifty books for children&nbsp;while also producing illustrations for "Cricket" and "Ladybug" magazines. She now lives in Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts, with her husband and their pets, a dog and a cat.</p>PreSchool-Grade 2. These sheep have been in a jeep, on a ship, in a shop, on a hike, and out to eat?maybe it's time they took a rest. Sheep Trick or Treat is just not up to par with the earlier titles. Shaw's familiar rhythm and rhyme are still in evidence as the six prepare costumes and head out trick or treating. They collect goodies from the farm animals ("Spiders give a dried-up fly. Sheep decide to pass it by"). And as one might expect, they are followed by wolves dressed in sheepskins. Apple's illustrations here are somewhat dark and shadowy. The sheep dressed as a vampire on the front cover may actually frighten some children. There is nothing terribly wrong with this book, but it just isn't very interesting. Unless you are badly in need of Halloween books, or have some die-hard fans who must see it, this is not a necessary addition to picture-book collections.

Rhyming sentences share encouraging words, asking young readers to embrace their differences and to see them as strengths. "There's lots of advice on the library shelf, like,/'You're an original, just be yourself.'/Really, that isn't so easy to do!/You have to learn what it means to be you." Digitally created artwork features a cast of mostly white children, on spreads that feature full-page images on one side, and white space with simple text on the other, allowing the softly hued illustrations&#x2014;embellished with chalk, watercolor, and pencil textures&#x2014;to speak on their own. The young children on each page are accompanied by a different type of animal, ranging from pigs to monkeys, seals, and panda bears. The cover photo, repeated in the book, features a pig-tailed exuberant preschooler with Down syndrome sitting on a seal with multiple medals around her neck. "Sooner or later, if you keep trying,/you'll try on something that's so satisfying/your heart will start whistling/ and POW! BADA BING!"

When do you decide to come out? Will your friends accept you? And how do you meet people to date? <em>Queer</em> is a humorous, engaging, and honest guide that helps LGBTQ teens come out to friends and family, navigate their social life, figure out if a crush is also queer, and challenge bigotry and homophobia. Personal stories from the authors and sidebars on queer history provide relatable context. This completely revised and updated edition is a must-read for any teen who thinks they might be queer or knows someone who is.</p></p><p><p><strong>Kathy Belge</strong> has been a freelance writer since 2003 specializing in the LGBT community.

This second edition combines some "it gets better" basics (coming out, dating, finding your people) as well as the good stuff authors are often forced to leave out of books aimed at teens (in this case, sex, STIs, how to tell if your relationship is abusive). The end result is a fun, easy to read, and occasionally hilarious guide that should be available on a shelf in every high school library in the U.S. (and, with the current age of coming out, many middle schools as well)."<br> &#x2015;Diane Anderson-Minshall, Editorial Director, <em>The Advocate</em> magazine</p> (<i>Other Print</i>)<br><br><p>"This second edition offers a solid foundation of knowledge for LGBTQ teens and those who want to better understand what it means to be queer. Topics include self-acceptance, coming out, dating, and sex. The information is general enough to fit a broad range of issues into just over 200 pages, but readers will still find many of their questions answered. The extensive resources will help them fill in additional information needs. Readers will learn about stereotypes, homophobia, and how to find a community of peers to provide a safe space. Hate and homophobia are handled with more nuance than in similar texts. The book examines what leads to hate and how teens can address it. Included in the text are a relationship quiz to identify any unhealthy behaviors and a table of sexually transmitted infections with symptoms and treatments. Belge and Bieschke use their respective experiences to illustrate the situations these teens may find themselves in.

In addition to near-encyclopedic coverage of the subject, the book is rich in sidebar features, many about queer history and others about the coauthors' personal experiences. The text is readily accessible and lively, even chatty and frank when necessary, especially in its coverage of queer sex and its pleasures and dangers. The book's contemporaneity is evidenced by its coverage of sex and technology and its extensive treatment of transgender issues. Comic spot art throughout enlivens a sometimes-sober text. <strong>A must-read for curious queer teens, the book is also of potential interest to adults interested in the subjects addressed.</strong> A useful list of resources is appended.

Several of her essays and articles have also been featured in online and print publications such as <i>Southwestern American Literary Journal</i>,<i> SageWoman Magazine</i>, <i>Rebelle Society</i>, and the <i>Manifest-Station</i>.Introduction<br><br>As a young girl, I relentlessly pursued every whim, dream, and desire that crossed the movie screen of my mind. I knew no fear. I believed in angels and guides from the world of Spirit, also known as the Great Mystery, Universe, God, Goddess, or any name you prefer. The idea of <i>Spirit</i> may be new to some people, and so I want to emphasize that each time I reference Spirit, I am pointing to an energetic force of Love and Light that is known by many names. I have chosen the name Spirit because it resonates with me and it is most often used to identify this Divine power. Spirit guides can be deities, angels, animals, crystals, ancestors, plants, directions, elements, or any other beneficial energy or entity.<br><br>I have always been aware of the subtle energies around me, from a passing stranger&#x2019;s sidelong glance to the cool tingle that indicates the presence of Spirit. In time, I excitedly tried to share my experiences with others. I wasn&#x2019;t well received. It was as if I were speaking a&nbsp;different language when I spoke of miracles or the profound impact of Spirit on my life. People called me weird and shut me out. Feeling hurt and alone, I worked hard to quiet the opinions, comments, and judgments of others so I could listen to the inner voice of my own free will, knowing, and individual spark.<br><br>At first, I was reckless and chased every wild whim (some quite dangerous) just to prove that I was in control of my decisions, but true self-reliance needs no approval from others. Instead of following the angry voice screaming at me to rebel against society and break down all my boundaries, I began to listen to the quieter, calming one within.<br><br>I am not saying we shouldn&#x2019;t push our limitations once in a while. That youthful teenage impulse to challenge everything is what keeps society from conforming to one mindset and us from falling dormant in a mundane, colorless life. I still took risks, but the risks I&#x2019;m talking about pertain to a willingness to be who I was meant to be&#x2014;a beloved and proud child of Spirit. This unbreakable, unapologetic will to be true to yourself is the cornerstone of magick.<br><br>Before I wrote the previous edition of this book, <i>The Teen Spell Book</i>, in 2001, I knew I was still angry and hurt about things that had happened in my past and I was letting these bitter feelings affect my present. It can be a long journey to heal wounds from our youth and teen years, especially if you bury them deep inside. I knew writing <i>The Teen Spell Book</i> would bring up these hurt feelings, but I also understood these wounds had become underlying negative influences in my life. It was a daring adventure! I read through old diaries from my teen years and sought out all the times I had felt disconnected from Spirit and my own lovability. I associated an emotion or action with each of these moments and wrote meditations, visualizations, and affirmations&#x2014;that is, spells&#x2014;to move toward my divinity and unconditional self-love.<br><br>In <i>The Book of Spells,</i> I hope to once again reach out, help you up, and serve as a nonjudgmental and accepting presence while you embark on your unique path of expression and connection with Spirit. It is difficult to be a lone light in a world where most others find it easier to shroud themselves in darkness&#x2014;but do not give up. You are not alone.<br><br>Sisters and brothers, we are torchbearers emerging from darkness, bringing the light of awareness to the forefront of society. &#x201c;We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them,&#x201d; said Albert Einstein. You possess the talent and ability to make all your dreams come true. The honor of keeping the lore of these wise ancient teachings alive rests on your capable shoulders. You have the power. You <i>are</i> power. You are the medicine you have been looking for.</p><h2>Godey&#39;s Fashions Coloring Book (Dover Fashion Coloring Book)</h2><p>Superbly rendered illustrations, adapted from <i>Godey's Lady's Book</i>, a rare nineteenth-century fashion magazine, provide authentic views of evolving Victorian modes of apparel &#x2014; from lace-edged necklines and elongated bodices to fitted bonnets and extravagant bustles. <br>Thirty ready-to-color illustrations depict lavish dresses and gowns of velvet and damask; smart riding outfits trimmed with braid and gilt; an elegant cashmere shawl, children's outfits; as well as hair ornaments, footwear, and other accessories. <br>A lovely collection that offers an authentic glimpse of what well-dressed ladies and youngsters of the Victorian era were wearing, this is a must-have for coloring book fans, costume designers, and cultural historians. <br></p><p>Ming-Ju Sun has worked in fashion advertising as an illustrator, art director, and photographer.

And even if she survives, she has to decide whether or not the job is worth the price of her soul.</p><p>It's a killer title: <i>The Devil Wears Prada</i>. And it's killer material: author Lauren Weisberger did a stint as assistant to Anna Wintour, the all-powerful editor of <i>Vogue</i> magazine. Now she's written a book, and this is its theme: narrator Andrea Sachs goes to work for Miranda Priestly, the all-powerful editor of <i>Runway</i> magazine. Turns out Miranda is quite the bossyboots. That's pretty much the extent of the novel, but it's plenty. Miranda's behavior is so insanely over-the-top that it's a gas to see what she'll do next, and to try to guess which incidents were culled from the real-life antics of the woman who's been called Anna "Nuclear" Wintour. For instance, when Miranda goes to Paris for the collections, Andrea receives a call back at the New York office (where, incidentally, she's not allowed to leave her desk to eat or go to the bathroom, lest her boss should call). Miranda bellows over the line: "I am standing in the pouring rain on the <i>rue de Rivoli</i> and my driver has vanished. Vanished! Find him immediately!" <p> This kind of thing is delicious fun to read about, though not as well written as its obvious antecedent, <i>The Nanny Diaries</i>. And therein lies the essential problem of the book. Andrea's goal in life is to work for <i>The New Yorker</i>--she's only sticking it out with Miranda for a job recommendation. But author Weisberger is such an inept, ungrammatical writer, you're positively rooting for her fictional alter ego not to get anywhere near <i>The New Yorker</i>. Still, Weisberger has certainly one-upped <i>Me Times Three</i> author Alex Witchel, whose magazine-world novel never gave us the inside dope that was the book's whole <i>raison d' etre</i>. For the most part, <i>The Devil Wears Prada</i> focuses on the outrageous Miranda Priestly, and she's an irresistible spectacle. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>A delightfully dishy novel about the all-time most impossible boss in the history of impossible bosses. <br>Andrea Sachs, a small-town girl fresh out of college, lands the job "a million girls would die for."

Founded in New York City in 1816, ABS is dedicated to the purpose of presenting the Bible in compelling ways, enabling readers to experience life in its fullness through faith in Jesus Christ. ABS has a number of &#34;firsts&#34; in its record books: the first Bibles in hotels, the first pocket Bibles for soldiers (during the Civil war), and the first Bibles provided for the U.S. Military in 1817. The Society extends its outreach internationally through the United Bible Societies (UBS), a fellowship of 126 international Bible societies, and was instrumental in founding this global fellowship in the interest of greater ministry impact and efficiency. In 1999 alone, more than 63 million copies of the Society&#39;s publications were distributed throughout the United States and the world. The CONTEMPORARY ENGLISH VERSION was published by the American Bible Society in response to an urgent need for a translation that would reach those many millions who are not reading the Bible. The goal was a Bible that is a serious translation-not a paraphrase-that combines historical and scholarly accuracy with contemporary language that everyone can understand. The result is a Bible that resonates with all people, wherever they may be in their spiritual journey. At last, a Bible that is easy to read, yet allows for a deeper connection to the very God who created us. Never before has there been a Bible that speaks so clearly to the heart and the mind of every reader.</p><h2>Mikrokosmos Volume 1 (Pink): Piano Solo</h2><p>(BH Piano). The definitive edition (1987) of the piano teaching classic. Includes an introduction by the composer&#39;s son Peter Bartok.

Stylistically Mikrokosmos reflects the influence of folk music on Bartok&#39;s life and the rhythms and harmonies employed create music that is as modern today as when the cycle was written. The 153 pieces making up Mikrokosmos are divided into six volumes arranged according to technical and musical difficulty. Major teaching points highlighted in Mikrokosmos 1: Unison melodies, Question and answer, Imitation and Inversion. Volume with pink covers have text in English, French, German, and Hungarian.

Heather's books have received many prestigious awards including the Children's Choice Award, Parent's Choice Award, CCBC Choices, ABC Best Books for Children, Best Children's Books of the Year, Book Sense Winter Children's Picks, and the National Parenting Publication Awards (NAPPA) among others.

Her illustration work has appeared in numerous magazines and she has won many awards for her illustrations. She has illustrated over twenty children's picture books. Whether working in muted impressionistic tones, in more vibrant colors, or in a folksy, homespun medium, Susan Gaber has built an impressive list of illustration credits, and has garnered much critical acclaim for her work. Working in watercolors, acrylics, or colored pencils, Gaber's illustrations "captivate the eye," as Barbara Elleman noted in School Library Journal. At times her artistic contributions imbue stories with a folksy feel, while others impart a lushness and vividness of tone, sometimes gaining the feel of elegant fine-art reproductions. Several years ago Susan's original paintings used to illustrate The Little Red Hen were displayed in the main branch of the New York Public Library at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street to celebrate Children's Book Week. Her versatility is particularly well suited to mythic stories and folk tales such as The Baker's Dozen or Stone Soup, both written by Heather Forest. Susan currently lives with her family in Huntington, New York.<br></p></p><h2>The Best Story</h2><p>The best story is one that comes from the heart The library is having a contest for the best story, and the quirky narrator of this story just has to win that rollercoaster ride with her favorite author! But what makes a story the best?<p> Her brother Tim says the best stories have lots of action. Her father thinks the best stories are the funniest. And Aunt Jane tells her the best stories have to make people cry. A story that does all these things doesn?t seem quite right, though, and the one thing the whole family can agree on is that the best story has to be your own.</p><p> Anne Wilsdorf?s hilarious illustrations perfectly capture this colorful family and their outrageous stories in Eileen Spinelli?s heartfelt tale about creativity and finding your own voice.<br><br></p><p></p></p><p>Eileen Spinelli lives in West Chester, Pennsylvania.<p> Anne Wilsdorf lives in Lausanne, Switzerland.</p>Grade 1&#x2013;3&#x2014;Spinelli fashions a plot that goes to the core of storytelling: writing from the heart. Motivated by the Red Brick Library's contest to "write the best story" and the added attraction of "a ride on the Sooper Dooper Looper roller coaster" with her favorite author, this pigtailed, blond (unnamed) heroine sets out to win the prize. Stymied, she consults her brother, who suggests action; her father, who wants plenty of humor; her Aunt Jane, who advises to make people cry; and cousin Anika, who longs for romance. The resulting hodgepodge satisfies no one&#x2014;including herself. Only after Mom's astute recommendation (writing from the heart) does the would-be author find satisfaction. Whether she wins the prize or not is left to speculation, but readers will realize that her "best story" is the one she accomplishes on her own. Wilsdorf perks up this somewhat predictable, but nevertheless affirming, tale with energetic, comical drawings awash in lively colors. As the story variations flow off the girl's writing pad, images of a pirate, a shark, a monkey, a cat, and a girl named Grace frolic across the pages in a variety of guises and situations. In addition, the amusing background details are sure to provoke a giggle. While this book may not attract individual readers, it will work well as an introduction to creative writing in the classroom and give hope to any young writer trying to turn an idea into a good story.&#x2014;<i>Barbara Elleman, Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art, Amherst, MA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Suddenly the loving environment she&#39;s come to know becomes an endless nightmare of violent abuse and twisted punishments as she&#39;s forced to confront the cruelty lurking inside the mother she idolizes. Based on a true story, Call Me Tuesday recounts, with raw emotion, a young girl&#39;s physical and mental torment at the mercy of the monster in her mother&#39;s clothes--a monster she doesn&#39;t know how to stop loving.</p><p>When I was a kid, I refused to believe my mother hated me. No matter how many times she said it, my young, optimistic mind simply would not allow it to be true. It wasn't until the day I felt her grip tighten at the back of my neck, as she submerged my head in scalding water and smashed my face into the bottom of the bathtub, that the terror of drowning grabbed me by the shoulders and shook the truth into me.<br><br>This, and all the abuse described in Call Me Tuesday is 100% true, and I, the author, am the one who endured it. Other parts of the book, like the names and locations, were fictionalized. I decided to do this out of respect for the people involved, but also, on a more personal level, I found it easier to write about the horrific and humiliating things that happened to a fictitious child named Tuesday than to write about the horrific and humiliating things that, in reality, happened to the little girl I used to be.<br><br>I'm adding this note because I feel it's important to make it clear that the abuse part of the book is true, so while reading the story you can keep it in the back of your mind that the kind of extreme maltreatment of a child at the hands of a parent, as detailed in Call Me Tuesday, does actually happen--something I believe everyone needs to know.<p>Allyson Ryan has narrated over eighty audiobooks, among them On the Divinity of Second Chances by Kaya McLaren, for which Allyson received an AudioFile Earphones Award.

Strega Nona saves her seeds from last year's garden, rotates her crops to keep the soil "happy and strong," and, much to Big Anthony's chagrin, explains the importance of compost and manure in the planting process. But most importantly, she stresses the need to sow seeds in orderly rows, a step Big Anthony chooses to ignore. The results are two very different gardens, as depicted by dePaola's familiar transparent acrylic illustrations, with bumbling Big Anthony having much more produce than he can handle.

Jeremy's father lived his life preparing for an early death, as foretold by a fortune-teller. He did, in fact, die when Jeremy was eight, but a package from him containing the locked box arrives one month before Jeremy's 13th birthday, the day on which the box is to be opened. With his friend Lizzy, Jeremy searches for the keys while contemplating the words engraved on the box, The Meaning of Life: For Jeremy Fink. 13th Birthday.

Mystery and adventure fans will be pulled in by the locked box, and, as a bonus, will get to know quirky, scientific Jeremy and impulsive Lizzy.

Visit him at dantat.com.<br><br>PreS-Gr 2-Santat and Willems pair up a hilarious installment in the series with a hysterical portrayal of metafiction for kids. Harold and Hog are huge fans of Gerald and Piggie. So much so, they decide to play dress up and pretend to be them. Harold dons glasses, and Hog wears a "Piggie" nose over his own, but it is far more of a challenge when it comes to embodying their personalities. Hog is not as carefree as Piggie, and Harold doesn't quite understand what it means to be careful like Gerald. This realization is a test of Harold and Hog's friendship-how can they be best friends like Gerald and Piggie if they can't be like them? Just as in every "Elephant and Piggie" book, friendship is tested and readers are led to a satisfying ending. Santat's detailed art style mirrors Willems's simplicity, but is distinct enough to let readers know that they are in a different world than his. Willems's readers will be thrilled at the choices that Santat makes in art and text, subtle and overt. Whether if it's picking up on the "stage" they create or when a familiar Easter egg is used, all will have readers rolling with laughter.

His eyes came to a focus on a rectangle of light on the wall of the building opposite, the light from a �second-�story window.<br><br>He had fallen from that window.<br><br>Lying perfectly still, he stared at the rectangle of light as if his life depended on it, yet an awareness was creeping into his consciousness that the window no longer mattered.<br><br>Only one thing mattered now&#x2014;escape. He must get away, clear away, and as quickly as possible.<br><br>There was throbbing in his skull, the dull, heavy beat that was driving everything �else from his brain. Impelled by what urge he could not guess, he lifted a hand toward his face. There was a twinge of pain from the arm, then he touched his face.<br><br>He did not know to whom the features belonged. Gingerly, he touched his skull&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there was �half-�caked blood, and a deep wound in his scalp. His hand dropped to his shirt, which was stiffening with blood.<br><br>Somebody had tried to kill him, and he felt sure that they would try again, and would not cease trying until he was dead. Nothing �else remained in his memory.<br><br>Stiffly, he turned his head, looking first one way and then the other. In the one direction there was blackness, in the other was light&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a street.<br><br>He was conscious of a faint stirring from the darkness behind the buildings. Something or someone was creeping along in the blackness, some enemy intent upon his destruction.<br><br>Heaving himself from the ground, he half fell against the building behind him. He remained there for a moment, struggling to gather himself for an effort. For he must escape. He had to get away.<br><br>A hand went to his hip. There was a holster there, but it was empty. Dropping to his knees, he felt quickly around him, but discovered nothing. His gun, then, must be up there, in that room. It had fallen or had been taken from him before he fell from the window.<br><br>He started blindly toward the street. He could hear music from the building beside him, a murmur of voices, then muffled laughter.<br><br>Staggering into the light, he paused and stared stupidly to left and right. The street was empty. Drunken with pain and shock, he started across the street and into the shadows of a space between the buildings diagonally across from the one he had left behind.<br><br>He had no idea where he was going, only that he must get away; he must be free of the town. Beyond the buildings between which he walked there �were scattered out�houses and corrals, and a few lightless shacks, and then he was walking in grass, tall grass.<br><br>Pausing, he glanced back. There was no pursuit, so why was he so sure there would be pursuit?<br><br>He went on, his brain numb with the pounding ache, until he saw before him a single red eye. Staring at it, he went ahead toward the red light. Suddenly he was beside it and his toe stumbled against the end of a railroad tie.<br><br>To his left the rails glimmered away into a vast darkness, on the right they led to a small railroad station. He had taken a stumbling step toward it when he brought up short, realizing his enemies would surely look for him there.<br><br>He stopped, swaying on his feet, trying to order his thoughts.<br><br>He did not know who he was. Or what he was.<br><br>His fingers felt of his clothing. The coat was tight across the shoulders and the sleeves �were a bit short, but it seemed to be of good material.<br><br>He glanced back at the town, but beyond the fact that it was a very small town it told him nothing. There had been hitching rails along the street, a few cow ponies standing there. Hence it was a western town.<br><br>He had heard the whistle a second time before it dawned upon him that a train was coming, and he would, if he remained where he was, be caught in the full glare of the headlight. He dropped into the grass not an instant too soon as the train came rushing out of the night.<br><br>A train offered escape, and escape would give him a chance to consider, to sort out what must have happened, to discover who he was and why he was pursued.<br><br>When the train had passed and drawn up at the station, he studied it with care. There �were at least three empty box cars, their doors invitingly open. Yet as he considered his chances of getting into the nearest one he heard a rush of �horses&#x2019; hoofs and twisted about from where he lay in the grass to see a party of �horse�men dash up to the train and split into two groups to �ride along both sides, checking every car, every rod and bumper.<br><br>He eased back farther into the grass, but he could hear them talking as they drew near.<br><br>&#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a waste of time. He was in bad shape, with blood all over, and staggering. He could never have made it to the tracks, believe me. If he&#x2019;s not hid somewheres in town he&#x2019;s lyin&#x2019; out yonder in the grass, bleedin&#x2019; to death.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He was a tough man for a tenderfoot.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t so sure he was&#x2014;a tenderfoot, I mean. Ben Janish swore he&#x2019;d got him, and did you ever know Ben to miss? That gent must have an iron skull!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aw, he&#x2019;s dead, all right! Dead or dyin&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br><br>They turned at the caboose and walked their �horses back along the train. They �were a dozen yards away when the whistle blew. Rising, he ran for the nearest empty car. A rider started to turn in his saddle, so he changed direction and leaped for the rear ladder and swung between the cars and out of sight.</p><h2>Anti Hero</h2><p><b>Piper P�jaro and Sloane MacBrute are two 13-year-old girls with very different lives but very similar secrets.

Yummy could be as tough as a pit bull sometimes. Other times he was as sweet as the sugary treats he loved to eat. Was Yummy some sort of monster, or just another kid? As Roger searches for the truth, he finds more and more questions. How did Yummy end up in so much trouble? Did he really kill someone? And why do all the answers seem to lead back to a gang-the same gang to which Roger's older brother belongs? Yummy: The Last Days of a Southside Shorty is a compelling graphic dramatization based on events that occurred in Chicago in 1994. This gritty exploration of youth gang life will force readers to question their own understandings of good and bad, right and wrong.<br></p></p><p>G. NERI is an award-winning filmmaker and new media producer from Los Angeles, where he also taught animation and storytelling to inner-city youth. Now living in Tampa, Florida, with his wife and their daughter, Neri writes for teens and younger children. Most recently, he received the 2010 Lee Bennett Hopkins Promising Poet Award from the International Reading Association (IRA).RANDY DUBURKE received the Coretta Scott King John Steptoe Award for New Talent in Illustration for his first book, The Moon Ring. He is a full-time artist whose work has also appeared in D.C. and Marvel comics, The New York Times Book Review, and Mad magazine. A native of Brooklyn, New York, DuBurke now lives in Switzerland with his wife and their two sons.A haunting, ripped-from-the-headlines account of youth gang violence in Chicago provides the backdrop for a crucial mediation on right and wrong. The fictional Roger, Neri's protagonist and moral compass, revisits the cautionary tale of classmate Robert "Yummy" Sandifer, an 11-year-old shorty with a sweet tooth, in this dramatic re-creation of his brief life. During the sweltering summer of 1994, Yummy's gang initiation goes horribly awry: A bullet intended for rival gangsters accidentally cuts down Shavon Dean, 14, a former childhood playmate. As the nation from Time magazine to then-President Clinton reels with shock, Yummy goes into hiding, setting the stage for Roger to investigate the "Little Killer's" beginnings before the summer, and Yummy's life, comes to a grisly end. DuBurke's raw illustrations evoke the heightened emotions of the time. The artist adeptly balances the contradictions of Yummy's life, as scenes of exaggerated violence (torching cars and looting stores) slowly dissolve into typical childhood vignettes (pet frogs and beloved teddy bears). A much-needed look at the terrifying perils of life on the margins that will have all readers pondering the heady question of moral responsibility. --Kirkus Reviews, *starred review*<br><br>What do you call an eleven-year-old gang assassin? A predator or a victim? In this graphic novel Neri reconstructs the events surrounding the brief life of Robert "Yummy"; Sandifer, a neglected and abused Chicago child who, after committing a string of felonies in 1994, shot teen bystander Shavon Dean, dodged the police for several days, and was ultimately executed by members of his own gang, the Black Disciples. Yummy's story, which became a national media flashpoint, may seem like ancient history to prospective readers born years after the murders, and the veneer of fiction supplied her (fictional Roseland resident Roger, also age eleven, tells about the neighborhood incident and worries about his own older brother, who is a known gang member) has the look of edgy urban lit. But author's notes and an appended bibliography (with the cited Time article "Crime: Murder in Miniature" readily available online) assure readers this is the real deal. Comics illustrator DuBurke's gritty black-and-white artwork employs foreshortened backgrounds to bring the action right up in the reader's face, whether it's talking heads calmly discussing their theories on Yummy's disordered personality, families in mourning, or a semiautomatic pointed directly out of the frame. Call it historical fiction to be technically correct, but for kids who still grow up believing that "you make it past 19 these days, you a senior citizen around here," it's heartbreakingly contemporary. --Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books, *starred review*<br><br>Told in stark panels of black and white, this stunning graphic novel tells the tragedy of Yummy but also indicts a society where there is only an outcry against the endless cycle of violence when one particular horrific incident captures the imagination of the community. The powerful artwork, full of shadows and deep contrast, emphasizes this terrible story of wasted childhood and senseless murder. The narrative, simply told and conveying a young boy's anguish, complements the artwork perfectly. Teens who enjoy standalone graphic novels will be drawn to the compelling story and art, and moved by the tragic unfolding of events. This novel would also be an excellent resource for a classroom discussion on gang violence. --VOYA, *highlighted review*</p><h2>The Life Recovery Devotional: Thirty Meditations from Scripture for Each Step in Recovery</h2><p>Inspired by the <i>Life Recovery Bible, The Life Recovery Devotional </i>takes readers on a devotional journey through the Twelve Steps, with thirty inspiring and encouraging meditations from Scripture for each step along the road to recovery.

Toasting marshmallows, telling ghost stories to scare one another, and catching fish was always fun.<br>One of the most memorable trips took place on the far side of Lake Lawtonka, at the base of Mt.

He and his best friend, Gary, spent the day shooting shad with bow and arrows, cutting bank poles, and getting ready to go when their dads got home from work.<br>Although there was no "monster" in Lake Lawtonka, one night there <i>was</i> a "sneak attack" by a rather large catfish tail.

The special talent of this author is entertaining kids while the adults think it is a lesson about the rainforest. Kids will sing, clap, and count their way among monkeys that hoot, ocelots that pounce, parrots that squawk, and boas that squeeze! It will not take much to have your child joyfully hooting and squawking too. And the illustrations are painstakingly all done in polymer clay and then photographed, giving a 3-D effect. They are truly remarkable, vividly conveying the abundant energy of a rainforest, and will inspire many an art project. Plus there are several pages of extension ideas for curriculum and art projects as well as resources on the web and elsewhere.<br><b>Please note:</b> The board book edition is 28 pages. It includes suggestions for children to do body movements as the text is read. It does not include additional information about the animals, rainforests, and the score of the song as is in the hardback and paperback editions.</p><p>PreSchool-Grade 3&#x2013;Another variation on the familiar song, this one enumerates some of the unusual fauna of the rain forest. It not only spotlights some of the animals&#x2013;marmosets, parrots, honey bears, leaf cutter ants, etc.&#x2013;but also offers pertinent information on the habitat. Berkes describes the different layers of the rainforest and its importance to our global ecology, and suggests movement activities for children to act out the rhyme. The unusual and colorful illustrations are made with polymer clay and then photographed, giving them a three-dimensional look. Each spread has the text and a number on the left against a dark-green leaf background, and shows one animal family with the correct number of babies as well as several other sets of indigenous flora or fauna to count. A long double page shows all the levels of the rain forest in cross section, and children are challenged to count the animals previously encountered and now hanging on the vines and hiding underneath the trees, etc. This is a handsome book on an important subject, and it can serve as recreational reading as well as an introduction to a basic unit on the rain forest.&#x2013;<i>Judith Constantinides, formerly at East Baton Rouge Parish Main Library, LA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Black-and-white images of storytellers and sites are featured throughout, and the book has a clean layout with sidebars. However, while the entries are well ordered and clear, there is no set structure in terms of naming or topic division. Entries on films, for instance, are named for the given movie, while other sections are named for the location where a sighting was reported. Other entries are items of interest (such as "Dogs and Bigfoot"), but there is no way to categorize these subjects and separate them out. In addition, the point of view of the encyclopedia lacks consistency: some entries are written in an academic style (though with no citations), while others read like personal stories (some even suggesting that Bigfoot is not only real, but also a danger to the general public). VERDICT While not recommended for reports or serious research, this title could be a good springboard for further reading if taken with a grain of salt.&#x2014;Heather Talty, formerly at Columbia Grammar &amp; Preparatory School, New York City</p><h2>Beyond Tears: Living After Losing a Child, Revised Edition</h2><p><p>Meant to comfort and give direction to bereaved parents, <i>Beyond Tears</i> is written by nine mothers who have each lost a child.

In <i>Beyond Tears,</i> nine mothers share their individual stories of how to survive in the darkest hour. They candidly share with other bereaved parents what to expect in the first year and long beyond:</p><p>*Harmonious relationships can become strained<br>*There is a new definition of what one considers "normal" <br>*The question "how many children do you have?" can be devastating<br>*Mothers and fathers mourn and cope differently<br>*Surviving siblings grieve and suffer as well<br>*There simply is no answer to the question "why?" </p><p>This sharing in itself is a catharsis and because each of these mothers lost her child at least seven years ago, she is in a unique position to provide perspective on what newly bereaved parents can expect to feel. The mothers of <i>Beyond Tears</i> offer reassurance that the clouds of grief do lessen with time and that grieving parents will find a way to live, and even laugh again.</p></p><p><p>The book was written by Ellen Mitchell, who has a regular weekend column in <i>Newsday</i>, together with a group of nine mothers who each have lost a child: Carol Barkin, Audrey Cohen, Lorenza Colletti, Barbara Eisenberg, Barbara Goldstein, Madelaine Perri Kasden, Phyllis Levine, Ariella Long, and Rita Volpe.</p><p>We are the closest of friends.

In a dark alley, Nikaido found Caiman, a man with a reptile head and a bad case of amnesia. To undo the spell, they're hunting and killing the Sorcerers in the Hole, hoping that eventually they'll kill the right one. But when En, the head Sorcerer, gets word of a lizard-man slaughtering his people, he sends a crew of "cleaners" into the Hole, igniting a war between two worlds.` <br><br> Caiman has left the Hole behind for the Sorcerers' dimension in an attempt to unravel the mysteries of his past. As the Sorcerers' "Blue Night" festival draws to a close, Nikaido finds herself taken captive. Supernatural crime-syndicate boss En has taken an inordinate interest in her abilities, which may be far different, and far more powerful, than anyone suspects. Oblivious to his best friend's danger, Caiman continues his quest to determine his true identity, picking up some unexpected help&#x2014;and meat pies&#x2014;in the process.

Though famed in particular for his paintings, Matisse also worked with drawing, sculpture, lithography, stained glass, and collage, developing his unique cut-out medium when old age left him unable to stand and paint.</p><p>Matisse&#x2019;s subjects were often conventional: nudes, portraits, and figures in landscapes, Oriental scenes, and interior views, but in his handling of bold color and fluid draftsmanship, he secured his place as a 20th-century master. It was Matisse&#x2019;s palette that particularly thrilled the modern imagination. With vivid blue, amethyst purple, egg-yolk yellow, and many shades beyond he liberated his work from a meticulous representation of reality and sought instead a &#x201c;vital harmony,&#x201d; often referring to music as an inspiration or analogy for his work.</p><p>A comprehensive and informative source, this lavishly illustrated publication has been revised in close collaboration with the Matisse estate. Including preparatory studies, full-page reproductions, and enlarged details, discover the artist's adventurous path, from the chromatic brilliance of his Fauve period, right through to his invention of gouache cut-outs at the ripe age of 80. Each image has been reproduced with painstaking care to create a viewing experience worthy of the expressionist par excellence.

Born in 1929, Anne Frank received a blank diary on her 13th birthday, just weeks before she and her family went into hiding in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam. Her marvelously detailed, engagingly personal entries chronicle 25 trying months of claustrophobic, quarrelsome intimacy with her parents, sister, a second family, and a middle-aged dentist who has little tolerance for Anne's vivacity. The diary's universal appeal stems from its riveting blend of the grubby particulars of life during wartime (scant, bad food; shabby, outgrown clothes that can't be replaced; constant fear of discovery) and candid discussion of emotions familiar to every adolescent (everyone criticizes me, no one sees my real nature, when will I be loved?). Yet Frank was no ordinary teen: the later entries reveal a sense of compassion and a spiritual depth remarkable in a girl barely 15. Her death epitomizes the madness of the Holocaust, but for the millions who meet Anne through her diary, it is also a very individual loss. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>For almost fifty years, Anne Frank&#39;s diary has moved millions with its testament to the human spirit&#39;s indestructibility, but readers have never seen the full text of this beloved book--until now. This new translation, performed by Winona Ryder, restores nearly one third of Anne&#39;s entries excised by her father in previous editions, revealing her burgeoning sexuality, her stormy relationship with her mother, and more.</p><h2>Lola Gets a Cat (Lola Reads)</h2><p>Lola wants a cat, but Mommy says taking care of a pet is a lot of work.

(Who Was?)</h2><p>Even as a kid, everyone thought Jeff Kinney was talented. People loved his drawings, and when he went to college, his comic strip Igdoof was so popular that it spread to other universities! Still, Jeff faced challenges. His cartoons were rejected by syndicates that claimed his art was unprofessional. Then, an idea struck: Jeff would write a journal from the perspective of a child, illustrated with doodles just like a kid might do. And so, the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series was born--and it was a hit! In this biography, Jeff&#39;s brother, Patrick Kinney, provides a knowledgeable look at the life of this best-selling author/illustrator. From Jeff&#39;s childhood pranks to his job developing online games, kids will love the chance to learn more about the creator of the popular Wimpy Kid books.</p><p>Patrick Kinney is a freelance writer living in Northern Virginia. He has written two books for children and provides creative content for Poptropica, a kids&#39; website.Who Is Jeff Kinney?<br> &nbsp;<br> Patricia and Brian Kinney&#x2019;s home in Virginia, there is a framed newspaper article hanging on the wall. The headline reads: &#x201c;Igdoof Takes On the Real World.&#x201d; There is a photo of their son Jeff, twenty-two years old, grinning next to a drawing of a bug-eyed cartoon character. That character was Igdoof. In college, Jeff wrote and illustrated a popular comic strip about him. The article predicted that Jeff would have no trouble becoming a professional cartoonist. That was his dream.<br> &nbsp;<br> But after several years of disappointment, Jeff wasn&#x2019;t so sure. When he came home to visit his parents, he&#x2019;d look at the article and frown. He wondered if his dream would ever come true.<br> &nbsp;<br> In college, Jeff had been a celebrity. Fans of&nbsp;<i>Igdoof </i>asked Jeff for his autograph. They wore T-shirts with characters from his comic strip on them. Besides Igdoof, there was a green bean named Pooshfa. Another was Jerome, a man with incredibly red lips. <br> &nbsp;<br> But to become a professional cartoonist, Jeff needed a <i>syndicate</i>. That&#x2019;s a company that sells comic strips to newspapers all over the United States. The trouble was, no syndicate liked <i>Igdoof</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> The rejection letters began piling up. One thing became clear to Jeff. His illustrations weren&#x2019;t good enough. They didn&#x2019;t look as professional as the artwork in <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i>, <i>The Far Side</i>, and other comic strips in the big newspapers. Jeff&#x2019;s drawings looked more like the doodles of a kid in middle school. Even so, Jeff knew he had funny ideas. He just needed a way to share them with an audience, the way he had in college.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jeff got an idea that might work. What if he wrote an illustrated journal from the point of view of a middle-school kid? Then his drawings wouldn&#x2019;t have to be all that good.<br> &nbsp;<br> That idea was the beginning of <i>Diary of a Wimpy Kid</i>, one of the most popular children&#x2019;s books ever.</p><h2>Where Is Curious George?: A Look and Find Book</h2><p>Join Curious George as he snoops around a wide variety of houses and homes.

But before long, the eraser discovers what can happen when two opposing forces come together to have fun. With humor and a keen eye for play, Max Amato crafts a delightful story that reveals the joys of collaborative imagination.</p><p>Max Amato studied at the Tyler School of Art and is a designer, art director, and illustrator based in Brooklyn, New York. This is his first picture book.PreS-Gr 2-In an "if you can't beat &#x2018;em, join'em" tale, an uptight neatnik learns to loosen up a bit. A rectangular pink eraser works hard at keeping the pages of this book free of any marks. Along comes a rogue pencil with an attitude that finds enjoyment in taunting the eraser with swirls and smudges, dirtying up the crisp, clean pages. The two characters, with stick arms and legs and expressive facial features, begin a battle of wills. Their conflict escalates as the pencil fills more of each page with dark gray and the exhausted eraser has trouble cleaning up after him. In a "lightbulb" moment, the eraser figures out that it is possible to make pictures by strategically omitting sections of a graphite-filled page, thereby creating his own designs. When the eraser finds himself once again on a pristine page, he discovers it's boring, so he sets about remedying the situation. The yellow pencil and pink eraser-whose reasons for existing would seem to be at cross-purposes-are the only colorful elements in this clever, humorous, and otherwise white and gray picture book.

May&#x2019;s famous <i>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer</i>.<br><br>Every year at Christmastime, everyone&#x2014;young and old alike&#x2014;has one catchy, joy-inspiring song stuck in their heads: &#x201c;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer!&#x201d; Now fans of the most famous reindeer of all-time will fall in love with the original story, written by Robert L. May in 1939.<br> <br>Rudolph, a youthful reindeer buck who possesses an unusual luminous red nose, is teased and excluded by his peers because of this trait. One particularly stormy Christmas Eve, Rudolph manages to prove himself after Santa Claus catches sight of his nose and asks him to lead his sleigh for the evening. Rudolph agrees, saving Christmas, and is finally treated the way he deserves by his fellow reindeer!</p><p>Robert L. May created Rudolph in 1939, when his company, the Montgomery Ward department stores, asked him to write a Christmas story that they could give away to customers. Drawing on the tale of &#x201c;The Ugly Duckling,&#x201d; Mr. May penned the story of a sweet, homely reindeer shunned because of his glowing red nose. Little did he know his creation was destined to become a Christmas holiday classic. Over the next few years, the company distributed millions of copies of <i>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer</i>. The book&#x2019;s copyright was transferred to Mr. May in 1947, and under his ownership, Rudolph&#x2019;s popularity soared. Commercial printings and cartoons quickly followed, and then, of course, came the song, which secured Rudolph&#x2019;s place in Christmas history, and in our hearts, forever. Robert L. May died in 1976.<br><br>Antonio Javier Caparo is a Cuban-born illustrator and designer. Although much of his early career was spent in graphic design, his passion for animation and comics led him to devote himself to illustration&#x2014;both traditional and digital. He has been published around the world and has won numerous awards in multiple countries. He lives in Quebec, Canada.Gr 2&#x2013;4&#x2014;Written in 1939 for Montgomery Ward department stores, this is the original story that created an icon and inspired the classic song. Told in the style of Clement Clarke Moore's "A Visit from St. Nicholas," Rudolph of the glowing red nose is teased by the other deer, only taking comfort in the coming of Santa. "He'd get just as much (and this is what pleased him) as the happier, handsomer reindeer who teased him." On Christmas Eve, with a foggy night causing mishaps and endangering his mission, Santa turns to Rudolph to save the day. While not indicated, this version of May's story has been adapted somewhat, with several couplets removed and some changes to words and phrases. This modernizes and streamlines the text, but also affects the richness of the language. The large trim size and many spreads make this a fun and easy choice for families and Rudolph fans to share.&#x2014;Brooke Sheets, Los Angeles Public Library</p><h2>Note Speller, Bk 2 (Schaum Method Supplement, Bk 2)</h2><p>The Schaum Note Speller has the unqualified testimonial of thousands of teachers who pronounce it &#39;The Best.&#39; Musical facts, beginning with line and space numbers are taught.

The road was a mere trail among low sandhills, with the dark outlines of square-�edged mesas looming against the sky.<br><br>Of course, Erik Hokart&#x2019;s letter was a part of it. That letter had come from a badly frightened man, and no man he had ever known was more cool, concise, and self-�sufficient than Erik Hokart.<br><br>There was no sound but that of the car itself, nothing to see but that narrow avenue of light carved by the headlights through a tunnel of darkness.<br><br>He leaned forward, peering into the night, trying to see the turnoff in time. On impulse he pulled over and stopped, shutting off the motor and the lights.<br><br>He sat very still in the darkness, listening. Listen�ing for what?<br><br>With the lights out, the desert was gray tufted with black spots of desert growth. Here and there loomed tall columns, and one rocky mass shaped like a pipe organ.<br><br>It was absolutely still. How rarely, he thought, can modern man experience a total silence! Yet the desert had it to offer, as well as the high mountains.<br><br>Opening the car door he stepped out into the chill night air, but he did not close the door behind him. The sound would have seemed like an obscenity in this all-�pervading stillness. A step away from the car, he stood listening.<br><br>What he hoped to hear was the approaching sound of Erik&#x2019;s four-�wheel-�drive vehicle. No doubt he was still too far away. Somewhere in the canyon ahead, Erik had suggested.<br><br>To the westward lay a long mesa, stark and black against the sky. That would be the one Erik had mentioned in his letter. It was also the one he himself remembered. Almost ten miles long and some two thousand feet high, the last three hundred to five hundred feet sheer rock. Had he ever mentioned to Erik his knowledge of that mesa?<br><br>As he turned back to the car, something flared at the corner of his eye. Turning quickly, startled, he stared at the flare on the mesa&#x2019;s dark rim.<br><br>For a space of what must have been thirty seconds it flared, changed color slightly, then vanished.<br><br>He stared at the end of the mesa where the light had appeared. A campfire was unlikely at that height, and in that location.<br><br>A crashed plane? He had heard no sound of motors, no explosion, seen nothing except that odd flare.<br><br>Puzzled and more than a little disturbed, he got back into his car, and a half mile farther he found the turnoff for which he was watching. He turned down a sandy slope and drove along the bottom of a dry wash. From here on, he had been advised, it would be rough going, even for a four-�wheel drive, but he had a shovel in the back of the car and some steel mesh he could unroll ahead if necessary. Many desert roads followed washes but he had never liked them. This was not the season for flash floods and the skies were clear, but flash floods had a way of happening when least expected. Long ago, when only a teenager, he had watched a man lose all he had in just such a flood.<br><br>The man had given him a lift, and it was raining hard in the mountains. They had reached a wash and he warned the driver it was not safe. The man had merely smiled tolerantly and started across the wide wash. Unhappily, about two thirds of the way across, they stuck in the sand. Working to free the car they almost missed hearing the roar of the oncoming waters.<br><br>A strange coolness touched their faces, and startled, they looked up. A wall of water, no less than eight feet high with great logs riding its crest, was sweeping around a bend of the narrower canyon.<br><br>The rush of water struck the canyon wall at the bend, throwing spray fifty feet into the air. For one frozen instant they stared, and then they ran.<br><br>The rushing wall of water was a good two hundred yards off, and they were less than thirty yards from the nearest bank. They beat the flood by half a step.<br><br>Turning, they looked back at the wash, running bank-�full. He remembered the shocked and empty look on the man&#x2019;s face.<br><br>He had said, &#x201c;This will run off in half an hour or less, but you&#x2019;d better forget your car. There will be nothing left but twisted metal with sand all through the engine block.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All I had was in that car,&#x201d; the man replied.<br><br>That had been a long time ago but he had saved his battered valise, although it contained only two worn pairs of blue jeans, some shirts, socks, and underwear. In those days he had always carried his razor and his comb in his pocket.<br><br>The wash down which he now drove showed evidence of more than one such flood. Brush and debris were piled against rocks and trees, some of it quite recent. In this country you worried when there were clouds over the mountains; in the Kunluns bordering Tibet on the north, you worried when the skies were clear, for on such days in that clear, thin air the hot sun melted the snows high in the mountains, and flash floods roared down the canyons when there was not a cloud in the sky.<br><br>Leaning forward, he peered at the mesa rim, but all was dark. The track he followed now split into several and he chose the one most followed. He swung wide around a big old cottonwood, a sure sign of ground water, and drove down the narrow alley of light, then to the crest of a low sandy hill. Getting out, he stood beside the car and listened into the night.<br><br>Irritably, he reflected that Erik could at least have met him halfway. He was tired and in no mood to prowl through this lonely country in the night.<br><br>Erik had suggested they meet on the Canyon road&#x2014;�which was so indefinite as to be totally unlike Erik. He himself had suggested they meet at Jacob&#x2019;s Monument, a monolith of stone they both knew and unlike any formation close by.<br><br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; Erik had said. &#x201c;Not there! Especially not there!&#x201d;<br><br>That was during their last telephone conversation, at least a month ago, when they had first talked of his coming for a visit. Three weeks later had come the letter, hastily scrawled, a desperate plea for help.<br><br>He glanced around uneasily, then backed up against the car. It was a lonely, eerie place.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No sooner had the thought come than he brushed it aside. Odd, how that old story had stuck in his mind, always lurking in the shadows of his memory, demanding to be recognized yet repeatedly brushed aside.<br><br>The trouble was, the story would not be dismissed, and no doubt a good part of his career since then had been influenced by it. Yet when he had first discussed this country with Erik he had not mentioned the story. Erik knew the country only from having flown over it in passing from New York or Chicago to Los Angeles, and he was not the sort of man to listen to such a tale with anything but impatience.<br><br>Mike Raglan had been nineteen when he first heard the story, and only two weeks later he had seen No Man&#x2019;s Mesa for the first time.<br><br>He had been employed in the old Katherine Mine near the Colorado River when the decision was made to cease operations for a while. Four of them had been sitting on the station at the 300 level discussing what to do next. They were eating their lunches with small appetite, as they would now be out of work and jobs were scarce. He had commented that he did not know where he would go.<br><br>&#x201c;Why not ride along with me?&#x201d; Jack had suggested. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve some claims up on the Vallecito and I must do the assessment work. There are mines around Durango and at Silverton and you might find a job.&#x201d; With nothing better in sight, Mike Raglan agreed.<br><br>Jack was a machineman and had been running a stoper on the same shift with him for several months. He was a congenial, easygoing man of sixty or more with memories of the great days at Goldfield, Tonopah, Rands�burg, and Cripple Creek. He had grown up in the Four Corners area and his grandmother had been a Paiute. He spoke the language well.<br><br>They had driven to Flagstaff and then to Tuba City. Farther along somewhere they had turned into an old trail for Navajo Mountain.<br><br>There were few places Jack hesitated to go with his old car. Its high center enabled it to straddle rocks that would have disabled a later model. He carried a kit of tools, a spare fanbelt, and odds and ends of nuts, bolts, and baling wire, as well as an axe, shovel, and saw. There were always a couple of five-�gallon cans of gasoline, one of water, and a roll of steel mesh used in crossing deep sand. There was literally no place he would not go when traveling or prospecting.</p><h2>Archangel Power Tarot Cards: A 78-Card Deck and Guidebook</h2><p>It&#x2019;s not enough to receive answers&#x2014;you also need courage, motivation, and empowerment to take decisive steps based on those answers.

Their creation was the result of Kirby's ceaseless curiosity about the origin of man and his mythologies - but like many of the King's concepts, it was defi nitely ahead of its time. Flash forward to 2006: Superstar creators Neil Gaiman and John Romita Jr. have boldly taken on these concepts with a loving hand, in the process telling a fresh and crackling fun yarn full of mystery, suspense and majestic power - all with an eye on helping establish Kirby's creations as a vital part of the Marvel Universe once and for all. Against the backdrop of Marvel's Civil War, the Eternals are awakening one by one from a strange, waking dream, at once coming to terms with the fact that they are far more than the normal people they have thought themselves to be. They find there is little time to commiserate about such things, however, as they are thrust into a life and death struggle that spans both time and space!<br><br></p><p>Jack Kirby's old Eternals series gets a serious dusting-off from Gaiman (<i>Anansi Boys</i>) and artist Romita. The Eternals, a super-race, are now scattered and forgetful of their powers and immortality, living mortal human lives of supreme normalcy (Sersi is a New York party girl, while Makkari believes himself to be Bellevue ER doc Mark Curry). Meanwhile their age-old enemies, the Deviants, stalk the earth with nefarious intentions, and at least one of the super-duper-race Celestials (who created both Deviants and Eternals eons ago) may be returning to Earth. The source of all this forgetfulness and strife appears to be the eternally 11-year-old Sprite, who desires to be allowed to age like an actual human. It is easy to spot Gaiman's touch in this modern-day clash between ancient forces, as he shies away from Kirby's '70s-era, <i>Chariots of God</i>&#x2013;style alien mythologizing to focus more on the characters' slow coming to grips with the enormity of their identity and the loss of humanity that comes from being an Eternal. Romita's storytelling is strong without coming near Kirby's epochal original. While Gaiman fans will still sign up, it isn't long before the tale gets tangled in the Olympian scope of this often baffling struggle. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

We watch it. We listen to it. We feel it. We try to predict it. But how well do we truly understand it? </p><p>Professional meteorologist Ryan Henning presents <i>Field Guide to the Weather</i>, a handy reference to meteorology and to the types of weather phenomena that one might encounter at home or in nature. It includes a simple introduction to the basics of meteorology&#x2015;explaining the aspects of the atmosphere that dictate how weather works. From there, the field guide looks at a variety of individual weather topics: cloud formation (and cloud-type identification), various forms of precipitation, and much more. The author goes on to discuss government-issued watches and warnings, and weather safety. Plus, readers are sure to appreciate the book&#x2019;s helpful guide to interpreting weather forecasts and available model information when planning an afternoon picnic or next week&#x2019;s vacation. </p><p><i>Field Guide to the Weather</i> is a perfect introduction to the science of weather. The information is captivating for kids and adults alike. The simple explanations are useful in easing the mind of a frightened child, and the in-depth details help adults learn to understand and prepare for the weather ahead.</p></p><p>Ryan Henning was born and raised in Minnesota, where he spent most of his formative years in the Minneapolis suburb of Victoria. There, he developed a fascination with the weather&#x2015;thanks largely to his dad's career in the airline industry. (Ryan loved the radar!) After earning a degree in synoptic meteorology from Purdue University, Ryan worked as an aviation meteorologist for eight years. He runs his own website and blog at Victoria-Weather.com.<p><b>Severe Weather Phenomena</b> </p><p>Some weather phenomena only occur during storms or severe weather events. Lightning and tornadoes are obvious examples, but flash floods, blizzards, and heat waves can also pose dangers to both people and property. Here&#x2019;s how to recognize such conditions and stay safe in them. Of course, the best preparation is staying informed; for information on weather watches, warnings, what they mean, and how to find out about severe weather in your area, see page 108.&nbsp; </p><p><b>Lightning</b> </p><p>You couldn&#x2019;t have thunderstorms without lightning, which is a byproduct of the aggressive updrafts within nimbus clouds. Thunderclouds form as warm air rises very quickly (upwards of 60 miles per hour); as the air rises, warm air condenses out, and the resulting water droplets brush past each other, producing static electricity. Electricity, much like air pressure, seeks an equilibrium or balance, so all that electricity eventually needs to find an outlet, either as a lightning bolt that connects with another cloud or as a bolt that strikes the ground.&nbsp; </p><p>Lightning takes the path of least resistance to connect positive and negative poles, which usually means that lightning stays within clouds, but when bolts reach down to the surface, they often like to find the most exposed, highest-reaching object on the ground, either the tallest tree in a forest, the tallest point of a building, or a lonesome boat in the middle of a lake. Often, of course, doesn&#x2019;t mean always. While the storms may be vast, lightning bolts are quite narrow, which means that the course a bolt takes to reach the surface might not include the absolute highest point of a region. Lightning also seeks the most conductive material, and it will bypass one tree for a more conductive type of wood or find a building with a metal antenna instead of one without. So if you hear thunder or see lightning, be sure to get someplace safe, preferably indoors. Just because lightning strikes a tree doesn&#x2019;t mean it can&#x2019;t finish its route to the surface by passing through someone standing near it.&nbsp; </p><p>On occasion, you may hear of heat lightning; this isn&#x2019;t a real meteorological term. It usually refers to lightning that is seen from a distance, without thunder. In such cases, what you&#x2019;re seeing is a storm that&#x2019;s producing lightning; it&#x2019;s just too far away for you to hear the thunder. </p><p><b>Thunder</b> </p><p>Thunder is the direct result of lightning; when a lightning bolt discharges, it is incredibly hot&#x2015;as much as 50,000 degrees. This causes the air surrounding the lightning bolt to become superheated, and this air expands away from the bolt, creating the massive crack of a lightning bolt and the long rumbles of thunder that echo across the terrain.&nbsp; </p><p><b>Staying Safe</b> </p><p>Thunderstorms are an odd weather phenomenon in that they have a built-in warning system: bolts of lightning that are visible for miles and thunder, which is usually hard to miss. If Mother Nature gives you that warning, it is best to heed it and get indoors. </p><p>If you are unable to get to shelter, it is important not to be the tallest object in your area (e.g. standing in the middle of a fairway when golfing or staying on a lake when fishing). Also, don&#x2019;t stand near or under other conductors because lightning bolts are capable of arcing from that object to you on their way to the ground. Trees are good conductors, and they therefore provide poor shelter from lightning.&nbsp; </p><p>If you are unable to get to safety and are in an open area, those that have been struck or nearly struck say that you can feel a rise in static electricity shortly before lightning strikes. If you have any reason to believe that a lightning strike is possible, the safest thing to do in an open field is to crouch and give yourself a low profile, while at the same time giving yourself less contact with the ground, which may return a charge back up to you if lightning were to strike nearby. </p><p><b>Tornadoes</b> </p><p>Tornadoes are often mistaken for clouds, but technically speaking, they aren&#x2019;t a cloud type. Instead, they are a tight circulation of wind that emanates from the base of wall clouds. Often, what appears to be a cloud toward the lower portion of a tornado is actually dust and debris drawn into its path by its high winds. </p><p>Tornadoes occur in thunderstorms with very strong updrafts. Updrafts, despite their name, draw air from all around a thunderstorm, rather than just below. Updrafts at the leading edge of a storm tend to be stronger and, therefore, can cause the entire storm to rotate. This rotating column of air will start to reach down on the rear side of the storm, in a feature called the rear flank downdraft, a process that creates a wall cloud. When that rotating column reaches the ground, a tornado is born. </p><p>It&#x2019;s difficult to predict the direction a tornado will move, especially in the short term, but they will generally move in the same direction of the thunderstorm. They vary in intensity through their life cycle on the ground and are measured using the Enhanced Fujita Scale, ranging from EF0 (wind speed below 85 mph) to EF5 (winds of greater than 200 mph). Unfortunately, we can only estimate the strength of a tornado after the fact, using damage surveys.&nbsp; </p><p><b>Staying Safe</b> </p><p>If a tornado is believed to be in the area, go to an interior, windowless room on the lowest level of the house, and put as many walls between yourself and the outdoors as you can. With strong winds and tornadoes, it is possible to get stuck out on the road or in an open area unable to reach shelter, and the best thing to do is keep a low profile. Tall vehicles, like trucks or vans, can be blown over, and remaining upright exposes you to more debris. Stay low and out of the wind if you are unable to find shelter.</p></p><h2>ESV Illuminated Scripture Journal: Esther</h2><p><p><em>ESV Illuminated Scripture Journals&nbsp;</em>pair the entirety of individual books of the&nbsp;Bible&nbsp;with a lightly dotted blank page opposite each page of Bible text, providing space to creatively engage with and reflect on the Word of God.

At an early age, he received a trumpet as a gift from his father. He practiced obsessively and eventually joined a California dance band. After graduating from high school, he ventured to New York City to study art under the tutelage of Joan Sloan and Harry Wickey at the Art Students' League. He managed to support himself throughout his schooling by playing his trumpet evenings, in nightclubs and at weddings.<br><br>Gradually, he eased into making a living sketching impressions of Broadway shows for <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Herald Tribune</i>. This shift was helped along, in no small part, by a rather heartbreaking incident: he lost his trumpet. One evening, he was so engrossed in sketching people on the subway, he simply forgot it was sitting on the seat beside him. This new career turned out to be a near-perfect fit for Don, though, as he had always loved the theater.<br><br>He was introduced to the world of children&#x2019;s literature when William Saroyan asked him to illustrate several books. Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was able to create his own theater: "I love the flow of turning the pages, the suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural. I work all the time, long into the night, and it's such a pleasure. I don't know when the time ends. I've never been happier in my life!"<br><br>Don died in 1978, after a long and successful career. He created many beloved characters in his lifetime, perhaps the most beloved among them a stuffed, overall-wearing bear named Corduroy.<br><br>Don Freeman was the author and illustrator of many popular books for children, including <i>Corduroy</i>, <i>A Pocket for Corduroy</i>, and the Caldecott Honor Book <i>Fly High, Fly Low</i>.</p><h2>Lily and Dunkin</h2><p><b>"Gephart has written a story that will speak not just to one specific community, but to humanity as a whole." &nbsp;--<i>VOYA</i><br><br>For readers who enjoyed <i>Wonder</i> and <i>Counting by 7's</i>, award-winning author Donna Gephart crafts a compelling dual narrative about two remarkable young people: Lily, a transgender girl, and Dunkin, a boy dealing with bipolar disorder.

Yet.<br>&nbsp;<br>But I&#x2019;m working on that.<br>&nbsp;<br>That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m in the closet. Literally in my mom&#x2019;s walk-in closet, with Meatball at my heels.<br>&nbsp;<br>I scratch under Meatball&#x2019;s chin, and his tiny pink tongue pokes out the side of his mouth. He&#x2019;s adorable like that.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Practice,&#x201d; I tell Meatball. &#x201c;Only six days until school starts.&#x201d; I have to do this. I can&#x2019;t. Have to. Can&#x2019;t. I almost feel my best friend (okay, my only friend), Dare, push me toward the dresses.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thinking about my plan for the first day of eighth grade makes my stomach drop, like I plunged over the crest of a roller coaster at Universal Studios. I&#x2019;m sure not one other person going to Gator Lake Middle is dealing with what I am, probably not one other person in the entire state of Florida. Statistically, I know that&#x2019;s not true, because I looked up a lot of information on the Internet, but it feels that way sometimes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Meatball&#x2019;s wagging his stubby tail so hard his whole body shakes. I wish the world were made of dogs. They love you one hundred percent of the time, no matter what.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got one for you,&#x201d; I tell Meatball as I pull a hanger from the rack. &#x201c;The past, the present and the future all walk into a bar.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I examine the summery red fabric. The tiny white flower print. I remember being with Mom when she bought this dress.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Ready for the punch line?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Meatball looks up at me with his big brown eyes, dark fur falling into them.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It was tense.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Silence.<br>&nbsp;<br>Holding the dress to my chest, I say, &#x201c;The past, the present and the future all walk into a bar. It was tense. Get it?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Meatball tilts his head, as though he&#x2019;s trying hard to understand. I scratch under his chin to let him know he&#x2019;s such a good dog and I&#x2019;m a total dork for telling a grammar joke to an animal.<br>&nbsp;<br>Then I focus on the dress.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;These are lilies of the valley,&#x201d; Mom said, pointing to the flowers when we were in the store. She held the dress to her cheek for a moment. &#x201c;Those were my favorite flowers when I was growing up in Burlington, New Jersey. We had them in the garden in front of our house, near the pink azalea bushes. They smelled so good!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I sniff the flowers now, as though the tiny, bell-shaped blossoms will smell like anything other than a dress. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad Dad&#x2019;s at Publix,&#x201d; I tell Meatball. &#x201c;And Mom&#x2019;s at her studio. Gives me time to put the first part of my plan into action. The practicing part.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Half of me is so excited I could explode. It feels good to finally be doing this. The other half--where other people&#x2019;s voices jam together in my brain--is terrified. Excited. Terrified. Yup, those are the right words.<br>&nbsp;<br>I take off my pajamas and let the dress slide over my head and body. The silky lining feels smooth and soft against my skin. It&#x2019;s hard to get the zipper up in the back. I consider going to Sarah&#x2019;s room and asking for help, but decide to do it myself, even though I know she&#x2019;d help me.<br>&nbsp;<br>When I was little, I tried on one of Sarah&#x2019;s old dresses and loved how it felt. How I felt in it. When Mom came home from work that day, she laughed and made me whirl and twirl. Even Dad laughed. Back then.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d; I ask Meatball while I twirl, feeling the skirt of the dress drift up, then back down against my legs.<br>&nbsp;<br>Meatball barks.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take that as an approval.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He barks again.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Or you might have to pee.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I slip into Mom&#x2019;s sandals, barely believing my feet have now grown as large as hers, but they have.<br>&nbsp;<br>In her full-length mirror, I see how the top of the dress bags out. If only I had something up there to fill it out, like Mom and Sarah do. I consider grabbing one of Mom&#x2019;s bras and stuffing it with socks, to see how it would look. How it would feel.<br>&nbsp;<br>A blaring car horn shatters my thoughts.<br>&nbsp;<br>Meatball barks.<br>&nbsp;<br>Scooping him under my arm, I put my face up close to his. &#x201c;Come on. Let&#x2019;s help Dad carry in the groceries.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He licks my nose.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh, Meatball, your breath is so bad.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He nuzzles into my arm.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;But your heart is so good.&#x201d; I kiss the top of his head. &#x201c;Hope Dad remembered Pop-Tarts. Breakfast of champions.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>As we rush down the stairs, I hear Sarah&#x2019;s bedroom door open behind me. When we reach the bottom, I let Meatball down, then hurry to the front door and fling it open.<br>&nbsp;<br>Dad&#x2019;s bent over, grabbing bags from the trunk of his car. I walk down the path to help. It&#x2019;s so bright and sunny, I have to shield my eyes with my forearm, but I can make out the back of Dad&#x2019;s T-shirt: The King Pines. I laugh out loud, realizing it was probably supposed to read The King Pins for one of the local bowling teams. Dad and his mom, Grandmom Ruth, run a T-shirt screen-printing business--We&#x2019;ve Got You Covered--and sometimes orders get messed up.<br>&nbsp;<br>Because Dad hates to waste anything, we all end up wearing his mistakes. My favorite was when a group of senior citizens asked Dad to make matching shirts for their upcoming vacation with the words The Bus Trippers. Dad goofed on the spacing, and the shirts ended up as The Bu Strippers. He had to redo the whole order. Those shirts got tossed, though, because Dad said there was no way any of us were wearing those rejects. It&#x2019;s funny how one little letter can make such a big difference to the meaning.<br>&nbsp;<br>Grandpop Bob, who started the business with Grandmom Ruth about a million years ago, used to say, &#x201c;Words have the power to change the world. Use them carefully.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>After two years without him, I still miss him and his wise words.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;m reaching my hand out to help when Dad turns toward me, each of his hands loaded with grocery bags.<br>&nbsp;<br>I hold my breath, hoping Dad understands how much this means to me. Hoping that this time will be different, that--<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Timothy! What the hell are you doing?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I deflate like a week-old balloon. Practicing, Dad. I&#x2019;m practicing being me.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You know the rule,&#x201d; he says, letting out a huge breath. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t be outside the house dressed like that.&#x201d; Dad shifts the bags in his hands. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s your mother?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I let my arms fall slack to my sides. I wouldn&#x2019;t have the energy to carry in the groceries now, if I wanted to. And I certainly don&#x2019;t have the energy to answer Dad. He should know Mom&#x2019;s at her yoga studio. It&#x2019;s not my job to remind him of her schedule.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Go back in the house, Tim.&#x201d; Dad sounds like the air has leaked out of him, too. I hate that I caused it. &#x201c;What if one of your classmates sees you? Imagine how they&#x2019;d make fun of you when school starts. Get in now. Go.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>They already make fun of me, Dad.<br>&nbsp;<br>He looks around. &#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s coming. Hurry.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I glance along the sidewalk. Someone is coming. A boy, carrying a Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts bag and grooving to some music only he can hear. I love the way he doesn&#x2019;t seem to care how he looks, dance-walking outside like that. He could be in a commercial for Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts: &#x201c;happy-looking, doughnut-carrying boy.&#x201d; I wish I felt that happy. I wish--<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Go!&#x201d; Dad says.<br>&nbsp;<br>I should walk back inside. Make it easier for Dad. Make it easier for myself.<br>&nbsp;<br>But I don&#x2019;t.</p><h2>First 50 Classical Pieces You Should Play on the Piano</h2><p>(Easy Piano Songbook).

Getting things done requires collaboration, and convincing others to contribute requires political skill; this book introduces the Exchange Model, in which you get what you need by offering something of value in return. The key lies in knowing what the other person values&#x2015;that's their "currency," and it's your immediate tool for coaxing their cooperation. This model has been proven over decades, as organizations around the world have turned away from frustration and resignation toward collaboration and results. This book shows you how to implement the Exchange Model at the personal, team, and organizational level to raise the bar for performance and leadership.</p> <p>This new third edition has been updated reflect the changing face of the workplace, and includes new examples and information on geographically dispersed virtual teams.

Jeffrey Sonnenfeld said it accomplished "the near impossible." Now, the <i>Third Edition</i> tops that. <i>Influence Without Aut</i>hority is the classic resource, revised and updated to reflect today's business environment. New chapters on influence and gender, and influence at a distance, enrich your perspective. The authors offer a proven strategy for getting desired results when you can't order cooperation. Applying the winning concept of influence without explicit authority enables you to get things done with colleagues, customers, and management who have their own agendas. </p><p><i>Influence Without Authority</i> shows what it takes to move others to accomplish important objectives, in a way that benefits them as well as you and your organization. The book's proven model builds on ways of working that you already know and use, though abandon when dealing with particularly difficult individuals, groups, or organizations. The authors walk you through techniques that will help overcome the things that get in your way of influencing in problematic situations and offer an approach that can dramatically increase your ability to complete even complex projects. </p><p>The model outlined is based on a universal principle of interaction social scientists call the Law of Reciprocity. The steps are simple: assume everyone is a potential ally; clarify your goals and priorities; diagnose the world of the other person; identify relevant currencies, theirs, yours; deal with relationships; and influence through give and take. Implementation can be complex. </p><p><i>Influence Without Authority</i> will give you the inside track for learning how to influence a team, task force, or committee as well as departments and divisions.

On a fateful summer afternoon in 1971 James Marshall lay on his hammock drawing pictures. His mother was inside the house watching <i>Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf</i> on TV. The strident voices of the movie's protagonists, George and Martha, split the quiet air, and as the sketches began to take shape, history was made... and James Marshall became one of the most prolific and successful author/illustrators of children's books.<br><br>He is best known for his series on the mischievous exploits of Fox, a debonair, lazy showoff; the uproarious adventures of the two Cut-Ups, Spud and Joe; George and Martha; and the misadventures of the Stupid family. <i>The Washington Post</i> said in a review of his work, "There are few better writers and illustrators for children now than Marshall. Certainly there is no one else working today who more successfully captures the child's point of view than does the creator of George and Martha and the Stupids." <i>The New York Times</i> said about the Fox books: "The miracle of Mr. Marshall's work is that so often his stories are as profound as they are simple."

They omit the second part, written c. 1684, where Christian&#39;s wife, Christiana, follows her husband. This edition, however, has both parts together as a single volume. Moreover, it contains the original illustrations by Frederick Barnard (which were engraved by the Dalziel brothers) and an index of Bible references Bunyan cited. These features allow the modern reader to experience the full weight of this classic allegory. Bunyan began writing this work while imprisoned for not obeying the state church in England. Still, Bunyan considered life&#39;s trials to be mild compared to the prospect of eternal separation from God. He reminds us that we are only pilgrims here; our home is elsewhere.

I worshipped Darren Stevens the First. When he'd come home from work and Samantha would say, &#x2018;Darren, would you like me to fix you a drink?' He'd always rest his briefcase on the table below the mirror in the foyer, wipe his forehead with a monogrammed handkerchief and say, &#x2018;Better make it a double.'" (from Chapter Two)</p><p>You may not know it, but you've met Augusten Burroughs. You've seen him on the street, in bars, on the subway, at restaurants: a twentysomething guy, nice suit, works in advertising. Regular. Ordinary. But when the ordinary person had two drinks, Augusten was circling the drain by having twelve; when the ordinary person went home at midnight, Augusten never went home at all. Loud, distracting ties, automated wake-up calls and cologne on the tongue could only hide so much for so long. At the request (well, it wasn't really a request) of his employers, Augusten lands in rehab, where his dreams of group therapy with Robert Downey Jr. are immediately dashed by grim reality of fluorescent lighting and paper hospital slippers. But when Augusten is forced to examine himself, something actually starts to click and that's when he finds himself in the worst trouble of all. Because when his thirty days are up, he has to return to his same drunken Manhattan life&#x2015;and live it sober. What follows is a memoir that's as moving as it is funny, as heartbreaking as it is true. <i>Dry </i>is the story of love, loss, and Starbucks as a Higher Power.</p></p><p>Fans of Augusten Burroughs's darkly funny memoir <i>Running with Scissors</i> were left wondering at the end of that book what would become of young Augusten after his squalid and fascinating childhood ended. In <i>Dry</i>, we find that although adult Augusten is doing well professionally, earning a handsome living as an ad writer for a top New York agency, Burroughs's personal life is a disaster. His apartment is a sea of empty Dewar's bottles, he stays out all night boozing, and he dabs cologne on his tongue in an unsuccessful attempt to mask the stench of alcohol on his breath at work. When his employer insists he seek help, Burroughs ships out to Minnesota for detoxification, counseling, and amusingly told anecdotes about the use of stuffed animals in group therapy. But after a month of such treatment, he's back in Manhattan and tenuously sober. And while its one thing to lay off the sauce in rehab, Burroughs learns that it's quite another to resume your former life while avoiding the alcohol that your former life was based around. This quest to remain sober is made dramatically more difficult, and the tale more harrowing, when Burroughs begins an ill-advised romance with a crack addict. Certainly the "recovered alcoholic fighting to stay sober" tale is not new territory for a memoirist. But Burroughs's account transcends clich�s: it doesn't adhere to the traditional "temptation narrowly resisted" storyline and it features, in Burroughs himself, a central character that is sympathetic even when he's neither likable nor admirable. But what ultimately makes this memoir such a terrific read is a brilliant and candid sense of humor that manages to stay dry even when recalling events where the author was anything but. <i>--John Moe</i><p><b>Augusten Burroughs</b> is the author of <i>Running with Scissors</i>, <i>Magical Thinking: True Stories</i>, <i>Possible Side Effects</i>, <i>A Wolf at the Table</i> and <i>You Better Not Cry</i>.

Bounds: Through Prayer, Prayer and Praying Men, The Essentials of Prayer, The Necessity of Prayer, The Possibilities in Prayer, Purpose in Prayer, The Weapon of Prayer</h2><p><b>This supreme anthology of books by E. M. Bounds unites his finest treatises on prayer and the enormity of prayer's power into one complete edition.</b><br><br>A committed lifelong Christian whose writings were frequent and numerous, E. M. Bounds acquired a reputation as a man convinced of the essential, life-affirming and life-enriching qualities of the Christian faith. He toured and lectured widely, and was praised by several contemporaries for both his oratory and written works.<br><br>In examining the texts within this volume, we realize how well they corroborate Bounds&#x2019; reputation as a serious, wise and intense servant of God. Said by associates to never utter foolishness, and to take meals and awaken early each day mindful of the Lord, Bounds was occasionally referred to by his acquaintances as an &#x2018;Eagle of God&#x2019; for his steadfast attitude and lifestyle. His seriousness was accompanied by passionate sermons where he was frequently moved to emotional displays. E. M. Bounds was by all accounts a preacher of great ability and grace.<br><br>All of the books herein have acquired a doughty reputation as referential guides possessed of a great usefulness and profundity. The Christian believer and scholar alike will be pleased to find a wealth of contemplative material, rich in historical and theological referencing. Bounds&#x2019; tone is one of reverence and unstinting conviction in belief, with the Lord&#x2019;s greatness discussed in a manner which is thoughtful and committed.<br><br>Every book in this collection contains the word &#x2018;Prayer&#x2019; in the title; the methods of praying were of great interest to Bounds, who sought to study the process intensely. The collection traverses several themes such as the origins and history of prayer; the methods of praying; the purposes of prayer; how prayer brings the believer closer to God; and how Christians may better utilize their time at prayer and emerge from each prayer spiritually nourished. <br><br>In writing these works, E. M. Bounds draws upon the Gospel texts and events, plus several of Christianity&#x2019;s most revered Saints. His immense study and education in Christian and Biblical history and canon is on full display, with each book backed with authoritative study and years of contemplation.<br><br>After E. M. Bounds&#x2019; departed from the mortal coil in 1913, his manuscripts were carefully compiled by Reverand Claudius (Claude) Lysias Chilton, Jr. , who had the following to say about the writings whose introduction to the world he supervised: <br><br><i>&#x201c;These books are unfailing wells for a lifetime of spiritual water-drawing. They are hidden treasures, wrought in the darkness of dawn and the heat of the noon, on the anvil of experience,and beaten into wondrous form by the mighty stroke of the divine. They are living voices whereby he, being dead, yet speaketh!&#x201d;</i></p><p></p><h2>Pete the Cat Saves Christmas: A Christmas Holiday Book for Kids</h2><p><p><strong>Now available in a paper-over-board edition!</strong></p><p><strong>A </strong><em><strong>New York Times</strong></em><strong> bestselling Pete the Cat holiday picture book!</strong></p><p>Spend the holidays with your favorite blue cat!

(Pack of 25) (Proclaiming the Gospel)</h2><p><p>No one in the whole world<br> Is a duplicate of you.<br> I&#x2019;m glad God made you special,<br> You&#x2019;re the one and only YOU!</p><p>It&#x2019;s true! No one else looks exactly like you and talks like you and thinks like you.</p><p>Look at your hands. No one else has fingerprints exactly like yours. God is so wise that he designed a fresh set for each person. He never has to use the same pattern twice!</p><p>Even if people tell you that you look like your mother or your Uncle Jim, you are the only one of you God made. Long before you were born he planned how you would look, from the top of your head down to your toes.</p><p>God made you so special because he loves you. He made you so that you could know him, and love him back.</p><p>God&#x2019;s special book, the Bible, says that God cares about each bird in the sky (Matthew 10:29). But he is much more interested in you (Matthew 10:31)!</p><p>God knows everything about us. He knows the good things that we do and the bad things that we don&#x2019;t want anyone to know about. The Bible says that we all have done bad things (sins) and that we all deserve to be punished for doing them (Romans 3:23; 6:23).</p><p>But you and I are so important to God that he sent his very own Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross and take the punishment we deserve.</p><p>&#x201c;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life&#x201d; (John 3:16).</p><p>God loves you so much that he wants to forgive you for your sins. But first you must agree with him that you have sinned. You must also believe Jesus died so you can be forgiven and live with God in heaven someday. If you truly believe that with all your heart, right now you can talk to God. Tell him that you accept Jesus&#x2019; death to take the punishment for your sins. He is always ready to listen to you. He wants you to be part of his family and to help you every day!</p></p><p></p><h2>If the Shoe Fits (Whatever After #2) (2)</h2><p>Tonight the mirror swept us into Cinderella's fairy tale.

Ganesha is just like any other kid, except that he has the head of an elephant and rides around on a magical mouse. And he loves sweets, but when Ganesha insists on biting into a super jumbo jawbreaker laddoo, his tusk breaks off! With the help of the wise poet Vyasa, and his friend Mr. Mouse, Ganesha learns that what seems broken can be quite useful after all. With vibrant, graphic illustrations, expressive characters, and offbeat humor, this is a wonderfully inventive rendition of a classic tale.</p><p>Sanjay Patel is an animator, storyboard artist, and short film director for Pixar Animation Studios. He lives in Oakland, California.<br><br>Emily Haynes is an editor by day and a children's writer by night. She lives in Oakland, California.With bright, elaborately detailed illustrations, this picture book tells a fictionalized story based on the legend of how the Hindu god Ganesha transcribed the epic poem Mahabharata. Here Ganesha is &#x201c;just like any other kid&#x201d; except that he has an elephant&#x2019;s head, and vividly colored pictures show him cruising around on a magical mouse. He loves sweets (he is a bit &#x201c;chubby&#x201d;), but when he bites down on &#x201c;the super jumbo jawbreaker laddoo,&#x201d; his tusk breaks off. He is furious and bitterly ashamed until he meets Vyasa the poet, who needs the tusk to write his poem, which is so long that &#x201c;all the pens in the world would break before it is done.&#x201d; So Ganesha helps the poet and uses his tusk to write the 100,000 verses of a story, which turns out to be so beautiful he even forgets about sweets. Blending computer graphics with traditional images, the intricate, stylized illustrations may be best suited for grade-schoolers, who will enjoy the story&#x2019;s turnarounds and focus on luscious sweets, and many will be ready for the classic Hindu myth.

He lives in London.K-Gr 2&#x2014;Young Rocket, an admirer of astronaut Mae Jemison, never stops telling others to "Look up!" Named for a rocket that blasted into space on the day she was born, Rocket is preparing herself to be the "greatest astronaut, star catcher, space walker who has ever lived." She sets up her telescope each night to wish on a star, her everyday clothing choice is an astronaut suit, star earrings are her favorites, and she has lots of information for those around her, especially concerning the Phoenix meteor shower to be visible that night. Her first-person commentary describes her family, her passion for space, and informs anyone who will listen about the Earth's travel through a comet's trail of dust. A multiethnic cast of characters with expressive cartoon faces fill this brightly colorful book with strong contrasts between indoor and outdoor images, variation of fonts, and speech or thought bubbles. All leads to the night sky event, when a frustrating sky search for the meteor awakens self-absorbed brother Jamal who finally turns off his phone to "Look up!" and give a bit of encouragement to his younger sister. VERDICT Ideal for space or science-inclined readers, this book includes brief information about outstanding scientist Jemison and a short list of facts about meteors and comets enclosed in an embrace of family relationships and a child's joy in the world around her.

He lives in Denmark with his wife and two daughters.</p>PreSchool-Grade 1-Written in quatrains that break into couplets across each double page, this lullaby rhyme catalogues various animals and their offspring, describing each mother's testament of love. The mountain nanny goat says, "'I love you as much as the mountain is steep'"; the camel says, "'I love you as much as the desert is dry.'" The book ends with a full quatrain of love poetry from a woman to her newborn child. Sorensen's paintings are large and bright, spanning double-page spreads and extending to the edge of each page, with full backgrounds and panoramic views that enhance the animal characters. The deep tones, well-lit landscapes (which contrast effectively with the darkness of the final picture), and the multiple layers of opaque paint suggest a formality of portraiture that is not usually seen in children's books. The text, which is discretely tucked away in the corners of the pages where it does not interrupt the effect of the illustration, is set in a decorative italic font. The potential for sentimentality is certainly present, but Melmed carefully avoids the cute and tearful. While reading this book is certainly a satisfying experience, full of pathos and meaning for parents, it's likely to appeal more to them than to their children.<br><i>Ruth K.

He was the first children&#x2019;s author ever to have been awarded a National Humanities Medal, and was twice a National Book Award Finalist.*Starred Review* There is a basic philosophy underlying this sweet mouse-out-in-the-world story: &#x201c;For every human on earth, there is a mouse doing the same job, and doing it better.&#x201d; A tiny, unnamed mouse, with notched ears and a tail that falls naturally into the shape of a question mark, attends the Royal Mews Mouse Academy, taught by toothy headmaster B. Chiroptera. But after being bullied by other mice and driven by the essential question of his identity, the mouse leaves the academy and hatches a rather unformed plan to visit ancient Queen Victoria, awaiting her Diamond Jubilee, in the hopes that the all-knowing monarch can tell him who he is. Along the way to Buckingham Palace, he rides in the ear of a horse named Peg (it&#x2019;s very waxy), falls into a punch bowl (it&#x2019;s very pink), and meets a cast of mice&#x2014;and bats&#x2014;who serve the queen. Murphy&#x2019;s black-and-white illustrations, with pulled quote captions, add charm in spades, and there&#x2019;s one tipped-in full-color illustration in each of the book&#x2019;s three main parts. You can&#x2019;t help but make comparisons to some other very famous books about mice, namely Kate DiCamillo&#x2019;s The Tale of Despereaux (2003) and E. B. White&#x2019;s Stuart Little, but the parallel world of mice and humans also echoes Mary Norton&#x2019;s The Borrowers (1952). Peck (A Year Down Yonder, 2000) is terrific in relaying small details, like the intricacy of mouse uniforms, and this clever yarn should delight fans of animal adventure stories. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: Peck is a Newbery Award winner for A Year Down Yonder and a two-time National Book Award finalist. This may be a book about a tiny mouse, but it&#x2019;ll be big on everyone&#x2019;s radar.

As children, we listened wide-eyed to Clement Clarke Moore&#x2019;s famous poem about the night before Christmas, when &#x201c;down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.&#x201d; At some point along the way, we may have asked an older and wiser acquaintance why Santa sometimes goes by this alias. The answer we received was probably not very informative. And once we are all grown up, with children of our own, and by chance are asked the same question, we still are not sure. If pressed, we might guess that there was once a very good man named Nicholas, and his name somehow came to be connected with Santa Claus. But Saint Nicholas remains an elusive figure to us.<br> <br>He is elusive even to scholars who study such matters. They believe that Saint Nicholas served as a bishop during the fourth century in the town of Myra, on the coast of the eastern Mediterranean Sea. He may have attended the famous Council of Nicaea convened by Constantine the Great in 325 to resolve issues troubling the Christian Church. But the details of his life and work remain sketchy. If he wrote anything, it is long gone. The first known Nicholas &#x201c;biography&#x201d; dates to the eighth or ninth century, long after his death, when a Greek monk known as Michael the Archimandrite assembled a collection of tales about him.<br> <br>We are left to piece together his life as best we can, using what we know and a good bit of surmise to arrive at the most likely story. Often we must rely on tradition as well as clues provided by the history of the times in which he lived. If the reputation he left behind means anything, we know there was something remarkable about this holy man. For hundreds of years, his name has been invoked, his deeds recounted. His shadow falls across epochs.<br> <br>Why bother with the history of Saint Nicholas? For one thing, his is a fascinating story. Its sheer vastness of scale is astounding. It stretches from the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa to the Americas and beyond. It crosses oceans, deserts, and frozen arctic climes. This is an adventure tale complete with emperors, knights, villains, shipwrecks, kidnappings, treasure, and dark dungeons. It is the age-old struggle of good against evil, of right against might.<br> <br>But there is a larger reason to remember Saint Nicholas: He matters to Christmas. This saintly man who lived so long ago has come to influence one of our holiest seasons and most beloved holidays. This influence that has come across so many centuries is a kind of miracle. It is evidence of God&#x2019;s love.<br> <br>One purpose of this book is to help put Saint Nicholas back into Christmas. It explains his connection with Santa Claus, and the common spirit they share. As you will see, Saint Nicholas makes Santa Claus a larger and richer figure than you might expect him to be.<br> <br>So here is the story of Nicholas, based on what we can reasonably conjecture. It is a story worth knowing. I hope that once you know it, you will remember Saint Nicholas each December. You may never again think of Santa Claus in quite the same way. If that is the case, then this book will have achieved its aim of helping to deepen the spirit of Christmas.</p><h2>Stained Glass Making Basics: All the Skills and Tools You Need to Get Started</h2><p>All the essential information and instruction the beginner needs to know to create stunning stained glass projects.

Among Russian writers, Leo Tolstoy is probably the best known to the Western world, largely because of War and Peace, his epic in prose, and Anna Karenina, one of the most splendid novels in any language. But during his long lifetime, Tolstoy also wrote enough shorter works to fill many volumes. The seven parts into which this book is divided include &#39;God Sees the Truth, but Waits&#39; and &#39;A Prisoner in the Caucasus&#39; which Tolstoy himself considered as his best. &#39;How Much Land Does a Man Need?&#39; depicting the greed of a peasant for land; the most brilliantly told parable, &#39;Ivan the Fool&#39; these are all contained in this volume. The book includes an active table of contents for easy navigation.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Leo Tolstoy was a Russian writer who primarily wrote novels and short stories. Later in life, he also wrote plays and essays. His two most famous works &#39;War and Peace&#39; and &#39;Anna Karenina&#39;, are acknowledged as two of the greatest novels of all time and a pinnacle of realist fiction. Many consider Tolstoy to have been one of the world&#39;s greatest novelists. Tolstoy is equally known for his complicated and paradoxical persona and for his extreme moralistic and ascetic views, which he adopted after a moral crisis and spiritual awakening in the 1870s, after which he also became noted as a moral thinker and social reformer. His literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus, centering on the Sermon on the Mount, caused him in later life to become a fervent Christian anarchist and anarcho-pacifist. His ideas on non-violent resistance, expressed in such works as &#39;The Kingdom of God is Within You&#39;, were to have a profound impact on such pivotal twentieth-century figures as Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr.&#34;</p><h2>The Real Heaven: What the Bible Actually Says</h2><p>Heaven has received a lot of attention in recent years as bestselling books and movies have told the stories of people who claim to have been there.

Milo is excited when he receives his detecting kit from Dash Marlowe, Super Sleuth. Dash&#x2019;s instructions (written in invisible ink) say to observe carefully, and the first thing Milo notices is his new neighbor, Jazz, reading Whodunnit magazine. Jazz wants to be a detective, too, and after some uneasy negotiations, the duo decide to partner up and find out what has happened to Jazz&#x2019;s brother&#x2019;s lucky (and stinky) socks. Without them, he&#x2019;s afraid he won&#x2019;t be able to pitch&nbsp;a winning game. The short chapters, written in a&nbsp;large typeface, are punctuated by pen-and-ink illustrations of better quality than those often seen in series books. Even kids who aren&#x2019;t sports-oriented will enjoy flexing their detective skills&nbsp;here and in&nbsp;the second installment in the series, The Case of the Poisoned&nbsp;Pig (2009). The story cleverly ends with new materials from Dash Marlowe,&nbsp;offering additional opportunities for armchair sleuthing. Grades 2-4. --Ilene Cooper</p><h2>Wild Fliers!

Toxic ideas first spread by higher education have undermined humanistic values, fueled intolerance, and widened divisions in our larger culture. Chaucer, Shakespeare and Milton? Oppressive. American history? Tyranny. Professors correcting grammar and spelling, or employers hiring by merit? Racist and sexist. Students emerge into the working world believing that human beings are defined by their skin color, gender, and sexual preference, and that oppression based on these characteristics is the American experience. Speech that challenges these campus orthodoxies is silenced with brute force.</p><p><i>The Diversity Delusion</i> argues that the root of this problem is the belief in America&#x2019;s endemic racism and sexism, a belief that has engendered a metastasizing diversity bureaucracy in society and academia. Diversity commissars denounce meritocratic standards as discriminatory, enforce hiring quotas, and teach students and adults alike to think of themselves as perpetual victims. From #MeToo mania that blurs flirtations with criminal acts, to implicit bias and diversity compliance training that sees racism in every interaction, Heather Mac Donald argues that we are creating a nation of narrowed minds, primed for grievance, and that we are putting our competitive edge at risk. </p><p>But there is hope in the works of authors, composers, and artists who have long inspired the best in us. Compiling the author&#x2019;s decades of research and writing on the subject, <i>The Diversity Delusion</i> calls for a return to the classical liberal pursuits of open-minded inquiry and expression, by which everyone can discover a common humanity.</p></p><p>Heather Mac Donald is the national bestselling author of <i>The War on Cops,</i> the Thomas W. Smith Fellow at the Manhattan Institute, and a contributing editor of <i>City Journal</i>. A former aspiring academic with roots in deconstruction and postmodernism, she has been the target of violent student protest for her work on policing. She holds a B.A. from Yale and an M.A. from Cambridge in English, and a J.D. from Stanford. Her writings have appeared in <i>The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, The New York Times, The New Republic, </i>and <i>Partisan Review,</i> among other publications. She lives in New York.<p>&#x201c;I read every word Heather Mac Donald writes and always have. She is brilliant and has tons of guts and is an inspiration." - <b>Peggy Noonan, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author and Pulitzer Prize Winner for Commentary</b></p><p>"Why should we care what happens in the Ivory Tower? Because what happens there very soon happens everywhere. Heather Mac Donald warns us: attend to the ideology now dominating the humanities and social sciences. Designed to undermine the integrity of the individual and the state alike, it does just that. The universities have a mandate to produce informed, educated, productive citizens. They have been transformed, instead, into factories of ideology that mass-produce victims, certain in their oppression, searching everywhere for oppressors to blame and to punish. And the ranks of those deemed tyrants and persecutors threaten to swell until every single one of us is deemed guilty in some manner or another. Beware." - <b>Jordan B. Peterson, bestselling author of <i>12 Rules for Life</i></b><br><b></b><br>"Universities justify their privileged position by claiming to be forums for the promotion of clarity, logic, and evidence. Yet their own policies, affecting millions, are too often defended with factual howlers, logical non sequiturs and mindless boilerplate. Heather Mac Donald may not persuade you on every point, but with her spitfire writing and scorn for nonsense she is forcing universities to live up to their own principles." -<b> Steven Pinker, Johnstone Professor of Psychology, Harvard University, and author of <i>Enlightenment Now</i></b><br><b><i></i></b><br><b><i></i></b>"Others besides Heather Mac Donald have indicted academia for devastating liberal education, but no one has ever documented the damage as Mac Donald does in <i>The Diversity Delusion</i>. It is crammed with facts and numbers that universities go to great lengths to hide. How she did it is a mystery, but <i>The Diversity Delusion</i> will be my master reference for anything I write on these topics." - <b>Charles Murray, Emeritus Scholar, American Enterprise Institute </b> </p><p>"Not since Alan Bloom's <i>The Closing of the American Mind</i> has a book so thoroughly exposed the damage done to American institutions--particularly universities--by modern liberalism's glib commitment to 'diversity.' Mac Donald unveils today's true operating principle: that claims of social justice precede the diminishment of Western greatness--a greatness that has (and will continue to) benefit the former victims of Western bigotry. This book is a story of what happens when too much insecurity seeps into a great civilization." - <b>Shelby Steele, author of <i>Shame, White Guilt,</i> and <i>The Content of Our Character</i></b> </p><p>"Heather Mac Donald is one of those rare writers who can cut through the fog of rhetoric that surrounds so many issues of our time, and reveal the underlying reality that others conceal. Her essays are a revelation and her books are an education. I have read both for years and have never been disappointed." - <b>Thomas Sowell </b> </p><p>"Compelling...Mac Donald rightly points out that the foundational purpose of a university, the transmission of knowledge to broaden our view of the human experience, is being lost to an ideological fixation on identity." - <i><b>Washington Examiner</b></i><br><i><b></b></i><br>"Mac Donald...is a walking encyclopedia with a razor-sharp wit, and she does not suffer fools gladly. [<i>The Diversity Delusion</i>] targets the liberal ideologues running America&#x2019;s higher education system, both exposing and debunking their agenda." - <i><b>The College Fix</b></i><br><i><b></b></i><br><i><b></b></i>"<i>The Diversity Delusion</i> does an admirable job of dismantling liberal academic narratives. And if anyone has earned the right to do that without looking back, it&#x2019;s Heather Mac Donald." - <i><b>National Review</b></i><br><i><b></b></i><br>"No one has been more persistent, on-target, and braver in challenging politically correct nonsense [than Mac Donald]." - <b><i>Center of the American Experiment</i></b><br><b><i></i></b><br><b><i></i></b>"<i>The Diversity Delusion</i> should set off alarm bells in the minds of Americans who have heard little or nothing about the damage it is doing to the nation." - <i><b>James G.

All rights reserved.</p>Grade 4-8 Set 18,000 years ago in prehistoric France, this is the story of a 14-year-old boy who longs to be a cave painter. This is forbidden, however, because Tao is not a Chosen Onehe's a tribal outcast with a crippled foot and no father to claim him. Forced into isolation by the superstitious leader, he befriends a wolf dog, Ram (another taboo), and the shaman, Greybeard, who teaches him to paint. When the tribe discovers this, they pit him against Saxon, the sacred bull. Tao is developed sympathetically, but his handicap is really a plot device to set up the central problem, for he has already overcome its physical drawbacks; it is the taboos and biases of his people over which he must triumph. The emotional connections between Tao and important minor characters are not conveyed strongly enough for readers to become involved and care. The motivations of the shaman are not always clear, and the cynicism he displays toward Tao smacks too much of a modern person sneering at savages, preventing readers from being swept up in the possible mindset of those who could believe in magic. There is no mystical wonderment at creation so beautifully evoked in Ann Turner's Time of the Bison (Macmillan, 1987). The taming of the wild dog is not as convincing as in Pryor's Seth of the Lion People (Morrow, 1988), which handles similar plot elements with more satisfying results, although both books occasionally use jarring anachronisms in their language. Despite its flaws, this book is interesting enough to introduce middle-graders to historical fiction. The superb cover will attract children, and, while the plot resolution seems a little forced, the exciting high points and the convincing setting will draw readers through.

Though Joseph's parents died too soon owing to frontier hardships, their teachings about kindness and fair play guide him as hurries to reclaim his sweet Sarah, the pony that is one of his only ties to his family. Joseph befriends a Chinese boy, despite widespread prejudice against Chinese immigrants working on the railroads, and together they tackle the challenges of navigating the 1890s Washington State wilderness, including bears, lost Wenatchi children, and raging rivers. Narrator Andrew Eiden's voice makes the dialect on the written page ("gonna," "gotta," "yammering," "ain't") flow smoothly to the ear. Joseph moves from one hair-raising adventure to the next, and (luckily for him) his kind and honest decisions consistently pay off.

She&#x2019;d given them to all the newspaper staffers who were moving on to middle school. Ofelia knew they were nice pencils. Not generic twelve for-two-dollars pencils. Each one was topped with a black eraser, and on its natural wood color was a quote by a man named Woody Guthrie: &#x201c;All you can write is what you see.&#x201d;<br> She had asked Ms. Niggli what the quote meant, and Ms. Niggli had answered in the way teachers do. &#x201c;What do <i>you </i>think it means?&#x201d;<br> Ofelia hoped it didn&#x2019;t mean that all you could write was, literally, what you saw. Woody Guthrie had obviously never lived in Sabal Palms, Florida.<br> What she saw outside the window of her mother&#x2019;s car on that first Monday morning of summer break was the same thing she saw every Monday morning. There was Do�a Amalia from next door wheeling her overflowing blue recycling bin across her driveway. The wheels crunched over gravel as she struggled to drag it. Once at the curb, she opened the lid and pulled out the topmost object. Then she aimed it at Chucho.<br> Chucho was a rooster that had shown up one day after a tropical storm battered their town. He moved into the tree in front of Do�a Amalia&#x2019;s house and never left. Someone on their street&#x2014;no one remembers who&#x2014;named him &#x201c;Chucho,&#x201d; and it stuck.<br> Chucho had the prettiest burnt-orange feathers, but his handsomeness didn&#x2019;t outweigh his bad habits. The rooster pooped on cars when Do�a Amalia had company parked out front. And if that wasn&#x2019;t bad enough, he crowed all day, like his internal alarm clock was out of whack, drawing the wrath not just of Ofelia&#x2019;s neighbor, but of the entire street.<br> As a rinsed-out can of Goya black beans flew through the air, it occurred to Ofelia that the only thing that really changed from week to week was the item Do�a Amalia threw at the bird with all the strength her seventy-something-year old arm could muster. The can missed its mark but startled the rooster who flew from his perch, squawking angrily as he strutted down the street. <br> Ofelia watched her mom make her way toward the car, purse hanging on her right shoulder, keys in hand.<br> &#x201c;Dale, Do�a Amalia!&#x201d; Mrs. Castillo called out. &#x201c;If you hit that bird, I&#x2019;ll make arroz con gallo for us.&#x201d;<br> Ha-ha, Ofelia thought. She pulled off her glasses and wiped them on her T-shirt. She didn&#x2019;t need them to see that the two women were now laughing like it was the first time her mom had made that joke.<br> She held up the pencil to her nose and inhaled the cedar scent. It smelled like an amazing story. It smelled like the truth. <i>That</i>, she realized, was all she could write. And <i>that</i> was what would win the Qwerty Sholes Journalism Contest.<br> Five lucky seventh-graders from around the country were picked each year to attend a summer journalism camp in New York City. Winning the contest not only meant being recognized for her writing. It meant going away without her parents and proving to them, once and for all, that she could be responsible and independent. But as she watched Do�a Amalia push down the contents of her recycling bin, close the lid, and head back up her driveway, she saw her Qwerty Sholes dreams circling the drain.<br> Ofelia sighed and looked at the blank page.<br> &#x201c;Let me remind you that you are not to write anything in your little notebook,&#x201d; Mrs. Castillo said, settling into the driver&#x2019;s seat and glancing in Ofelia&#x2019;s direction. &#x201c;Nothing you see, nothing you hear.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;What kinds of things might I see or hear that I <i>shouldn&#x2019;t</i> write about?&#x201d; She wiggled her eyebrows at her mom.<br> &#x201c;Ni una palabra, Ofelia,&#x201d; Mrs. Castillo warned again.<br> &#x201c;None of your Nancy Drew business.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Nancy Drew is a sleuth,&#x201d; Ofelia said. &#x201c;She looks for clues to solve mysteries. I&#x2019;m a journalist. I look for stories to write.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Hmm,&#x201d; Mrs. Castillo said. &#x201c;Both sound nosy to me.&#x201d;<br> Ofelia thought about what her mother said. She knew that she wanted to be a journalist when she learned about the muckrakers in social studies class. In the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, journalists like Ida B. Wells, Nellie Bly, and Ida Tarbell exposed corruption. They noticed injustices and then, through their stories, forced the world to notice them too.<br> Ms. Niggli said no one really used the term <i>muckraker</i> anymore, that today they call them investigative journalists. Still, Ofelia relished the idea of raking the muck off and exposing things. Like raking the tomato sauce off the &#x201c;meatballs&#x201d; in the school cafeteria and exposing them for the textured vegetable protein balls they really were. Or like the topic of her very first story in the second grade&#x2014;an expos� on the three wise men&#x2014;after she caught her parents, not los Reyes Magos, leaving gifts for her on January 6. It made her wonder what else the adults in her life were hiding.<br> Maybe she could be Nancy Drew <i>and</i> Ida B. Wells all in one. She certainly didn&#x2019;t want to be a Lois Lane type of journalist who didn&#x2019;t even realize that Clark Kent was Superman wearing glasses.<br> &#x201c;But what am I supposed to do there all summer, Ma?&#x201d; Ofelia asked, struggling to keep from whining.<br> In books and movies, summer break meant spending your days outside looking for adventures. Her friend Andrea was flying alone to visit her cousins in California, and then she was going to sleepaway camp. Ofelia, on the other hand, got to go to work with her mom.<br> She squirmed with embarrassment and wondered how many twelve-year-olds had parents as overprotective as hers. She knew kids who were unsupervised after school and during the summer and went to the movies with friends, not with their parents.<br> &#x201c;When I was a little girl in Cuba, we would make a whole game out of an empty box,&#x201d; Mrs. Castillo said, proudly. &#x201c;You can help me if you need something to do. I&#x2019;m going to be very busy with the preparations for the Floras Centennial.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Just point me to the nearest box, please,&#x201d; Ofelia said with fake enthusiasm.<br> &#x201c;Bueno, read, be bored,&#x201d; Mrs. Castillo said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not the worst thing in the world.&#x201d;<br> Ofelia stuck the pencil in her mouth and bit down so hard the thin glossy coat over the word <i>can</i> cracked between her teeth.

The reason could be that no one has provided convincing evidence showing how it is different from astral projection. </p><p>If you&#x2019;re uncertain whether spiritual travel is used by God or only by the New Age and the occult, this book will help you uncover the truth. The author compares astral projection and spiritual travel side by side. His research suggests that they are not the same thing. He provides a thorough examination of the scriptures which demonstrate that the prophets and apostles have been traveling in the spirit for centuries. Far from being restricted to the occult, spiritual travel is actually a tool that is intended to be used by God to accomplish His divine purposes.</p><p>With the same down-to-earth teaching style he used in <i>Seeing in the Spirit Made Simple</i> and <i>Divine Healing Made Simple</i>, <b>Praying Medic</b> provides Bible-based teaching, dozens of testimonies and simple illustrations that will help even the least experienced person understand spiritual travel. Exercises are provided at the end of key chapters to help activate your spirit.</p><p><b>Traveling in the Spirit Made Simple</b> can help you in the practice of divine healing, deliverance, intercession and many other forms of ministry. But most importantly, it will help you know God in a more personal way.</p><p>This book is part of a series <i>The Kingdom of God Made Simple</i> &#x2014; a self-study course designed to train believers to live the life offered to them as heirs of God's kingdom.</p><p><b>Here&#x2019;s a preview of what you&#x2019;ll learn:</b></p><ul><li>A comparison of astral projection and Christian spiritual travel</li><li>Myths and misconceptions about spiritual travel</li><li>The divine purposes for traveling in the spirit</li><li>The biblical basis for traveling in the spirit</li><li>The nature of the spiritual world</li><li>Traveling in the spirit in dreams</li><li>Translation by Faith</li><li>Translocation</li><li>Trances</li><li>Time Travel</li><li>The silver cord</li><li>The Divine Council</li><li>Mansions in heaven</li><li>The nature of portals</li><li>The Courts of Heaven</li><li>Heaven&#x2019;s strategy room</li><li>Confirmation of spiritual travel</li><li>Speaking with the cloud of witnesses</li></ul></p><p></p><h2>Love, Santa</h2><p>In a series of letters, a young girl writes to Santa to ask about the North Pole, Mrs. Claus, and of course, Christmas goodies. Year after year, Santa writes back, and a heartwarming relationship develops, until one year, the girl writes to her mother instead: Mom, are you Santa? Her mother responds to say that no, she is not Santa. Because Santa is bigger than any one person -- we bring him out through kindness to one another and the power of imagination. This transformative tale spins a universal childhood experience into a story about love, giving, and the spirit of Christmas.</p><p>Martha Brockenbrough is the author of two books for adults and five books for young readers, including <i>The Game of Love and Death</i>, which earned four starred reviews and was a Kirkus Prize finalist; <i>Devine Intervention</i>; and <i>The Dinosaur Tooth Fairy</i>.

He lives in Portland, Oregon, with his wife and young son.Gr 2&#x2013;4&#x2014;A young girl named Lucy has been exchanging letters with Santa every Christmas since she was five. As she grows older, she begins to have questions. Why does his writing look like her mom's? How does he visit every house? She begins to put the pieces together, and she writes her mom a letter asking if she is Santa. Her mom writes her back that she is not Santa, that Santa teaches us to believe, and that he has help getting down all those chimneys by those whose hearts he has filled with joy. While Lucy is saddened by this coming-of-age moment, she is also inspired to carry on the spirit of Santa. The watercolor and mixed-media artwork is sweet and cheerful and sets just the right tone for the sensitive conversations. The letters that Lucy writes to Santa are contained in envelopes inside the book, which unfortunately are likely to get lost in a library setting. The story pulls at the heartstrings and provides the perfect words that many parents struggle to find.

But his favorite is the great spruce, with its sturdy trunk and branches that stretch up to the sky. Alec&#x2019;s grandpa planted it as a sapling years and years before Alec was born, and every Christmas, Alec and his grandpa decorate the tree together, weaving tinsel and lights through its branches, making it shine bright.<br>&nbsp;<br>But one day, a few curious men from the nearby city take notice of Alec&#x2019;s glistening great spruce, and ask to take it away for their Christmas celebration. Though it&#x2019;s a huge honor, Alec&#x2019;s heartbroken at the idea of losing his friend. With great courage and creativity, Alec comes up with a plan to save his favorite tree in this joyful holiday tale.</p><p><b>John Duvall</b> grew up on Long Island, New York, where he started work as a tree climber--a job that quickly developed into a lifelong passion for trees. In 2009, he wrote an op-ed for the <i>New York Times </i>about the Christmas tree tradition. John is a tree-care consultant in New York. <i>The Great Spruce </i>is his debut picture book.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Rebecca Gibbon</b> is the illustrator of several picture books, including <i>Papa Is a Poet, Celebritrees, </i>and <i>Elizabeth Leads the Way</i>, which was named an ALA Notable Book. Rebecca lives in England with her husband and their two sons.K-Gr 2&#x2014;In this picture book debut, the author addresses a subject close to his heart. Alec is a boy who lives in the country and loves to climb trees, particularly a great spruce, planted decades ago by his grandfather. Every winter he and his grandpa decorate the tree for Christmas, until one year when some men ask his parents if they can use it for the distant city's annual Christmas celebration. Alec's parents consider it an honor, but Alec protests, declaring that the tree could be borrowed instead. It takes time and work, but the tree is carefully dug up, shipped to the city on a barge, and placed in the city center to be enjoyed by everyone. After the holidays, it is returned to Alec's yard and continues to grow, while a sapling takes root in the city square. In an author's note Duvall discusses the tradition of decorating a tree for Christmas, as well as the origin of the annual Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center in New York City. There was a brief time when the center used live trees, and Duvall makes the case for returning to this practice rather than killing a valuable living tree. Gibbon's illustrations are large and brightly hued, with a naive style and a shifting perspective that highlights the size and grandeur of the great spruce.

S. Lewis struck me as the most thoroughly <i>converted</i> man I ever met," observes Walter Hooper in this book's preface. "His whole vision of life was such that the natural and the supernatural seemed inseparably combined."<br><br><i>God in the Dock</i> contains forty-eight essays and twelve letters written by Lewis between 1940 and 1963. Ranging from popular newspaper articles to learned defenses of the faith, these pieces cover topics as varied as the logic of theism, good and evil, miracles, the role of women in the church, and ethics and politics. Many represent Lewis's first ventures into themes he would later treat in full-length books.</p><p>C. S. Lewis (1898-1963) taught English literature at both Oxford and Cambridge Universities and wrote more than thirty influential scholarly and popular books. Among his many famous works are Mere Christianity,The Screw tape Letters, the Chronicles of Narniavolumes, Miracles, and Surprised by Joy.<b>-- <i>The New York Times</i></b><br>"Here the reader finds the tough-minded polemicist relishing the debate; here too the kindly teacher explaining a complex abstraction by means of clarifying analogies; here the public speaker addressing his varied audience with all the humility and grace of a man who knows how much more remains to be known."<br><br><b>-- <i>Christianity Today</i></b><br>"For those who know little of C. S. Lewis or his ideas, this book is a good introduction. . . . <i>God in the Dock</i> contains some of the best of Lewis's witty apologetics.

It&#x2019;s called the &#x201c;hands-free technique&#x201d;. It uses the principles of a bread machine... without the bread machine.There are three basic methods for making bread... -Knead by hand... the most common method.-Bread machine... very popular, but your loaf will have a silly little paddle in the bottom.-No-knead... a method in which Mother Nature does the kneading for you.This cookbook uses the &#x201c;no-knead&#x201d; method. The advantages are... -No kneading... Mother Nature does the kneading for you.-No yeast proofing... instant yeast doesn&#x2019;t require proofing.-No special equipment (no mixer, no bread machine)... entire process is done in a glass bowl with a spoon and spatula, and can be baked in a wide variety of baking vessels (bread pan, uncovered baker, skillet, preheated Dutch oven, etc.).-Only 4 ingredients (flour, salt, yeast and water)... to which other ingredients can be added to make a variety of specialty breads.There are two methods for making no-knead bread...-Traditional... proofs for 8 to 24 hours.-&#x201c;Turbo&#x201d;... ready to bake in 2-1/2 hours.This cookbook will start by teaching you how to make no-knead bread using the traditional method, then &#x201c;Turbo&#x201d; method, because the traditional method is more popular and a little easier.No-knead bread can be bake in a variety of baking vessels...-Bread pan... the #1 baking vessel for bread-Dutch oven... ideal for baking a round loaf (boule)-Long covered baker... ideal for baking half loaves and long loaves.-Poor man&#x2019;s Dutch oven... combines the ease of baking in a bread pan with the principles of baking in a Dutch oven.This cookbook starts by showing you how to bake no-knead bread in a bread pan... it&#x2019;s easy and safer than working with a hot Dutch oven. Then we will expand our use of baking vessels to include the Dutch oven, covered baker, and &#x201c;poor man&#x2019;s Dutch oven&#x201d; (PMDO).And we won&#x2019;t stop there. This cookbook will also show you how to make rolls, pizza, and pretzels..-Rolls... you&#x2019;ll learn how to use bakeware to shape the rolls for you.-Pizza... you&#x2019;ll learn how to make you own pizza dough.-Pretzels... add one step to the process and you&#x2019;ll have pretzels.What makes this cookbook different from others is... -&#x201c;Hands-free technique&#x201d;... a new and innovative technique that uses the handle end of a plastic spoon to manipulate the dough (like a dough hook) after which the dough goes straight from the mixing bowl to the baking vessel (bread pan, etc.) without dusting the work surface with flour or touching the dough with your hands.-&#x201c;Roll-to-coat&#x201d;... an innovative technique that coats the dough ball with flour in the mixing bowl. No more sticky dough. When the dough comes out of the bowl it will be easy to handle if you wish to divide the dough into portion to make baguettes, rolls, etc.-&#x201c;Poor man&#x2019;s Dutch oven&#x201d;... new and innovative technique which combines the ease of baking in a bread pan with the principles of baking in a Dutch oven.The cookbook also includes sections that will help you understand ingredients, technique, and bakeware.In others words, I start with the simplest recipe, then add one technique or method until you&#x2019;re a master baker. Step by step, this cookbook will take you on a journey you will love and enjoy.Thanks - Steve</p><p></p><h2>The Reflection Guide to The Impact Cycle: What Instructional Coaches Should Do to Foster Powerful Improvements in Teaching</h2><p><p><strong>"Jim Knight is one of the wise men of coaching.

They say a lot of things about the Schwa, but one thing&#x2019;s for sure: no one ever noticed him. Except me. My name is Antsy Bonano, and I was the one who realized the Schwa was &#x201c;functionally invisible&#x201d; and used him to make some big bucks. But I was also the one who caused him more grief than a friend should. So if you all just shut up and listen, I&#x2019;ll tell you everything there is to know about the Schwa, from how he got his name, to what really happened with his mom. I&#x2019;ll spill everything. Unless, of course, &#x201c;the Schwa Effect&#x201d; wipes him out of my brain before I&#x2019;m done....</p><p>Neal Shusterman is an award-winning author and screenwriter.&nbsp; He lives in Southern California with his four children.Starred Review. Grade 7-10&#x2013;Eighth-grader "Antsy" Bonano recounts how his accidental relationship with three quirky characters winds up being mutually beneficial. The catalyst in this social collision is Calvin Schwa, a classmate who has an almost supernatural knack for going completely unnoticed. When Antsy decides to become an "agent" for the "nearly invisible" Schwa by entertaining wagers on what he can get away with by being able to fly almost entirely beneath the social radar, the boys enjoy temporary success until they accept a dare requiring "The Schwa" to enter the home of a legendary local eccentric and retrieve a dog bowl belonging to any one of his 14 Afghans. Crawley, a powerful restaurateur who also happens to be severely agoraphobic, nabs the unlikely young intruders, and the crusty shut-in orders them to return daily to walk his dogs in exchange for their impunity. Once Antsy has gained Crawley's trust, he is asked to perform another task: to act as a companion for the man's blind granddaughter, Lexie. Antsy is then flanked by two peers&#x2013;one who cannot see and one who cannot be seen&#x2013;and, together, they overcome their collective liabilities through friendship, improving their own lives and the lives of those around them. Antsy tells his story in a bubbly Beastie Boys-meet-Bugs Bunny Brooklynese that keeps the pages flipping, and Shusterman's characters&#x2013;reminiscent of those crafted by E. L. Konigsburg and Jerry Spinelli&#x2013;are infused with the kind of controlled, precocious improbability that magically vivifies the finest children's classics.<i>&#x2013;Jeffrey Hastings, Highlander Way Middle School, Howell, MI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

You can almost feel the salt spray on your face and smell the musky scent of ocean in the cool morning air. Remember how the sand squishes between your toes as the tide rushes to shore and taste the tang of the ocean on your lips. Spirited language evokes a sense of closeness and nostalgia for an old friend. The inspiration of the ocean will make learning the five senses as easy as a day at the beach.<br><br> Crisp, realistic illustrations fill the pages with the rush of surf and the warmth of sun-baked sand. The sights and smells and sensations of the sea become vividly clear in these beautifully rendered paintings.</p><p>Pam Mu�oz Ryan is a native of California. She received her bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degrees at San Diego State University and she worked as a bilingual teacher and an early childhood administrator before dedicating herself full-time to writing. She wrote her first book at the age of 32 at the encouragement of a friend. She has written many picture books for young children and novels for older students. Pam lives in California with her husband and four children. She often speaks at schools and conferences about writing and literacy.This rhyming picture book about the pleasures of a day at the beach gets off to a rocky start. "Hello, ocean,/ my old best friend./ I'm here,/ with the five of me, again!" read the opening lines, but only four figures appear on the page. It may take repeated readings for youngsters to understand that the "five of me" refers to the girl's five senses--despite the bold type for words like "hear" and "sounds" (though, curiously, in the first verse, "I see the ocean,/ gray, green, blue,..." the word "see" is not in bold). Ryan's (Amelia and Eleanor Go for a Ride; Esperanza Rising) descriptions of the seaside are strongest when she sticks to concrete examples of the child's experience: the look of "amber seaweed,/ speckled sand,/ bubbly waves that kiss the land" and the feel of "squishy,/ sandy,/ soggy ground,/ slippery seaweed that wraps around." Her metaphors, on the other hand, sometimes become abstract ("I hear the ocean,/ a lion's roar,/ crashing rumors/ toward the shore"). Astrella's (The Desert Alphabet Book) acrylics on airbrushed paper take on an almost photographic quality. His sun-washed shades vary in intensity from the subtly blended blues and greens of the surf to a range of beach-ball tones: the orange of a seagull's feet, the pinks and purples of a bathing suit and the fire-engine red of a picnic cooler.

But something is missing in her life. So, one cold November morning, she takes a handful of sleeping pills expecting never to wake up. But she does&#x2014;at a mental hospital where she is told that she has only days to live.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>Inspired by events in Coelho&#x2019;s own life,&nbsp;<em>Veronika Decides to Die</em>&nbsp;questions the meaning of madness and celebrates individuals who do not fit into patterns society considers to be normal. Bold and illuminating, it is a dazzling portrait of a young woman at the crossroads of despair and liberation, and a poetic, exuberant appreciation of each day as a renewed opportunity.</p><p>When Paulo Coelho (<i>The Alchemist</i>) was a young man, his parents had him committed to mental hospitals three times because he wanted to be an artist--an unacceptable profession in Brazil at the time. During his numerous forced incarcerations he vowed to write some day about his experiences and the injustices of involuntary commitment. In this fable-like novel, Coelho makes good on his promise, with the creation of a fictional character named Veronika who decides to kill herself when faced with all that is wrong with the world and how powerless she feels to change anything. Although she survives her initial suicide attempt, she is committed to a mental hospital where she begins to wrestle with the meaning of mental illness and whether forced drugging should be inflicted on patients who don't fit into the narrow definition of "normal." The strength and tragedy of Veronika's fictional story was instrumental in passing new government regulations in Brazil that have made it more difficult to have a person involuntarily committed. Like any great storyteller, Coelho has used the realm of fiction to magically infiltrate and alter the realm of reality. <i>--Gail Hudson</i><p>Paulo Coelho, born in Rio de Janeiro in 1947, is one of the bestselling and most influential authors in the world. <em>The Alchemist</em>, <em>The Pilgrimage</em>, <em>The Valkyries, Brida</em>, <em>Veronika Decides to Die</em>, <em>Eleven Minutes</em>, <em>The Zahir</em>, <em>The Witch of Portobello</em>, <em>The Winner Stands Alone</em>, <em>Aleph</em>, <em>Manuscript Found in Accra</em>, and <em>Adultery</em>, among others, have sold over 175 million copies worldwide, and <em>The Alchemist</em> has been on the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list for over 360 weeks.</p><p>Paulo Coelho has been a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters since 2002, and in 2007, he was appointed United Nations Messenger of Peace.

Catechists and parents will find this Catechism an invaluable teaching tool as they prepare children and catechumens to receive the Sacraments and lead authentic Catholic lives. Students will find this an uncomplicated and friendly guide to authentic Catholicism. <br><br>The Set contains all four of our Baltimore Catechisms; No. 1; No. 2; No. 3 and No. 4 - the Explanation of the Baltimore Catechism (teacher\'s edition). <br><br> These are the original TAN editions of the Baltimore Catechism, with updated typesetting, fresh new covers, larger format, quality bindings and the same trusted content.</p><p>The Third Plenary Council of Baltimore was an American assembly held in the nineteenth century. Presiding were Archbishop Gibbons, the Apostolic Delegate, in addition to thirteen other archbishops, sixty-one bishops or their representatives, six abbots, and a religious general. Its sessions were held from the ninth of November to the seventh of December, 1884, and were comprised of twelve decrees. The Third Council is most noteworthy for the vigorous Catholic school building campaign which it spawned, commanding all parishes to provide Catholic education. It also produced the popular <i>Baltimore Catechism</i> for schoolchildren.<br></p><h2>Banana Fish, Vol. 3 (3)</h2><p>VICE CITY: NEW YORK IN THE 80s...

He spots a chicken who seems just right, but then he thinks how much more stew there will be if he fattens her up before dining himself. So he goes home and begins to cook all kinds of scrumptious food for the chicken to eat. A big surprise is in store for the wolf when he finally visits Mrs. Chicken to collect his meal.</p><p>Keiko Kasza was born on a small Japanese island in the Inland Sea of Japan. She grew up in a typical Japanese extended family with her parents, two brothers, and grandparents. Uncles, aunts, and cousins also lived nearby. "All the steps I took growing up were very normal," Ms. Kasza says. "The only unusual thing I did was go to college in the United States." She graduated with a degree in graphic design from California State University at Northridge. Ms. Kasza married an American, and the United States has been her home ever since.<p>After publishing five children's books in Japan and working as a graphic designer for fourteen years, Ms. Kasza decided in 1988 to devote her time to picture books. She says, "Having two small boys and two professions was too much to handle."</p><p>Ms. Kasza admires many great picture-book creators, such as Leo Lionni and Maurice Sendak, but says that the work of Arnold Lobel has influenced her the most. The subtle humor and warmth he created in his books continues to inspire me," she says. "I often go back to his work when I get discouraged or lose confidence."</p><p>Ms. Kasza compares the process of making a book to acting on stage under the lights:<br>"I become the character that I'm working on at that moment. I pretend that I'm a bird looking for a mother, or a pig trying to impress his girlfriend. When I'm acting, I'm a child myself."</p><p>Ms. Kasza's ambition is not to create a hundred books, but to "create one really good book that will be kept on the family bookshelves for generations, although a hundred really good books would be even better, of course!"</p><p>Keiko Kasza lives in Indiana with her husband and two sons.</p><p>copyright � 2000 by Penguin Putnam Books for Young Readers.

On returning to claim his fat hen, he finds that her 100 chicks have shared the treats, and are now enamored of ``Uncle Wolf.'' Children will enjoy both the wolf's scheming and his comeuppance, as well as the story's repetitive form. The wolf's speech is problematic, though, as it switches from correct and somewhat formal usage (``Ah, she is just perfect for my stew'') to a sort of dialect (``Aw, shucks. . .I'll bake the little critters a hundred scrumptious cookies!''). Kasza's illustrations far surpass the story. Deft watercolors on wide open white pages, they convey the scheming wolf and the unflappable hen in a way that the text does not. The Wolf's Chicken Stew just needs a little more meat.

So when she finds a teeny tiny camera on the school playground one afternoon, she can hardly believe her luck. She wants to keep the camera in the worst way, but there's one little problem: It isn't hers. </p><p>Ruthie swears to her teacher and to her classmate Martin that she got the camera for her birthday. But deep down, Ruthie knows better, and all day long that teeny tiny camera weighs on her conscience until she can hardly stand it. How could one little camera turn into such a great big problem?</p></p><p>LAURA RANKIN's picture books include <i>Rabbit Ears </i>and <i>No Babysitters Allowed,</i> by Amber Stewart, <i>Fluffy and Baron</i>, and <i>The Handmade Alphabet</i>. She has also illustrated the Harriet Bean mysteries by Alexander McCall Smith. She lives in Maine where she likes to collect all kinds of teeny tiny things.Ruthie, a fox girl, loves teeny-tiny things, so when she finds a miniature camera in the schoolyard, she claims it as her own. And lies about it when fellow student Martin tells their teacher, Mrs. Olsen, that the camera belongs to Ruthie. The rest of the afternoon is long for Ruthie, and at home that night, she ruminates over her crime until she finally comes clean with her parents. Having been counseled that honesty is the best policy, Ruthie, with much trepidation, tells her teacher and Martin what she has done. Mrs. Olsen praises her for telling the truth, and Martin forgives her, too. A real-life situation might not have such a happy ending, but this gets right to the heart of what children feel when they know they&#39;ve done something wrong but don&#39;t know how to set things right. The sprightly artwork is cheery in all respects, except when it comes to Ruthie. With subtle brushstrokes, Rankin captures all the varied emotions Ruthie goes through: glee, defiance, worry, fear, and eventually relief.

When the first English national curriculum was unveiled in 1989, its "Attainment Target 1" was "Using and Applying Mathematics"&nbsp;<br> "Pupils should use number, algebra and measures in practical tasks, in real-life problems and to investigate within mathematics itself."<br> Successive incarnations of the national curriculum had similar sections or statements. Problem was, we tended not to turn to this bit. It was the more particular 'add two two-digit numbers'-type statements that we turned to on a week-by-week basis. Why? Maybe the process skills are, when expressed this way, too general, too all-pervasive; it's easier to turn to the more specific, to the 'know the names for various kinds of triangles' sort of requirement.<br><br> But the process skills are where the mathematics really happens!<br><br> In the US, the Common Core State Standards for mathematical practice are:<ul><li>Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.</li><li>Reason abstractly and quantitatively.</li><li>Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.</li><li>Model with mathematics.</li><li>Use appropriate tools strategically.</li><li>Attend to precision.</li><li>Look for and make use of structure.</li></ul>I suspect there will be the same tendency to pass quickly to the more week-by-week standards. &nbsp;And yet these skills are the core of what it is to work mathematically. What to do? How to make 'reasoning abstractly and quantitatively' less nebulous-sounding?<br> Enter Mike Flynn's book&nbsp;<i>Beyond Answers</i>.<br><br> Mike devotes a chapter to each of the mathematical practices. He begins each with a personal experience. This is useful in a number of ways. One, it's good to get to know the author of a book you're reading. It somehow makes the exchange more on the level, more real. Two, he gives an analogy for the practice from his own experience. I like analogies; they work well for me, and I guess they do for other people too. They ground the practices in our everyday non-mathematical experience.<br><br> For instance, in the introduction Mike talks about getting lost in Boston, a town he wasn't that familiar with, and how his brother helped him to learn to navigate the city without helping him too much, by asking powerful guiding questions.<br><br> I like the metaphor in lots of ways. For one, mathematics is like a city, with links criss-crossing it in all sorts of ways. Also, navigating is a primal kind of function for us, one we share with animals, whether hunting or fleeing, patrolling or harvesting. I&nbsp;blogged about the link for me once. The book is about how we help students to navigate for themselves, developing skills to find their way round, to become at home in the world of mathematics.<br><br> Another thing I like about the book lots is that it gives us a lot of classroom vignettes that exemplify teachers enabling their young students to develop the standards. It's an approach that's worked well in a number of great recent teacher education books, because we learn by concrete example more than by definition.<br><br> There can often be just one adult in the classroom, me, the teacher, and though we learn so much from the students themselves, how do we get to learn from other adults? Well, these kind of vignettes let us peek in at key moments, listen to an actual conversation, catch how adroitly the teacher puts themselves to one side while she allows ideas to come from the students rather than her.<br><br> There&#x2019;s a consistent emphasis on student voice in the book. &#x2018;The benefit of taking extra time to discuss their strategies is that it allows ideas to come from the students and not from me. That means they have opportunities to hear mathematical arguments from their peers and to critique their reasoning (MP3). It also helps to create ownership of the ideas and changes the power structure in the classroom by showing that we all contribute to the learning in math class&#x2019; (p123).<br> &nbsp;<br><br> It&#x2019;s important that we think about the big picture of what we&#x2019;re doing in mathematics lessons, and how it links ultimately with what we do in the adult world, and Mike takes time to spell out the essentials of each mathematical practice.<br><br> In the chapter on MP 4,&nbsp;<i>Model with Mathematics</i>, Mike discusses one of the essentials of modelling, the process of abstraction.&nbsp;<br><br> Abstraction is an essential tool way beyond the maths curriculum, as&nbsp;I&#x2019;ve mentioned in a post before, but Mike helps us see how it&#x2019;s there in so many of the simple tasks we give young children.<br><br> He gives the example of a first grade class who are asked to make representations of who sits at their tables (p84). They show it in lots of ways:<br> &nbsp;<br> <br> &nbsp;<br> The students are learning to ignore, for this task, the myriad other important features of the situation, the appearance and personalities, how they&#x2019;re relating and feeling, what their position is in relation to each other, and just to focus on number and one category, boy/girl. This narrow focus, ignoring most of the context, is something young students learn through practice.&nbsp;<br><br> You can see how this process works with adult mathematical modelling, how for instance a traffic planner ignores all sorts of context in traffic, car colour and make for instance, to mathematise the situation, focusing on numerical data such as number of cars and speeds. Once she&#x2019;s represented the structure of the network of roads and the numbers she needs, she doesn&#x2019;t for a while need to think about them as roads or cars as such. After calculating possible solutions, she can then translate them back into road locations, numbers of lanes, traffic capacities and suchlike, and ultimately actual road construction can begin.<br><br> Young children learn to do essentially the same thing. Mathematising is there all the way. When we count a handful of pebbles, for a short while we attend less to colour and texture, to shape and size. Or, if we sort by shape, we might ignore all the other features.&nbsp;<br><br> The three-act task, as Mike says, is a really useful tool for helping students to mathematise.&nbsp;Graham Fletcher&#x2019;s great collection&nbsp;is a great introduction to this, and one I&#x2019;ve just been sharing with teachers in Qatar.<br><br> In Chapter 5 (<i>Use mathematical tools strategically</i>) Mike lists examples of tools in five categories: supplies, manipulatives, representation tools, digital tools, and mathematical tools. I was particularly interested in the discussion of the last, also called &#x2018;thinking tools&#x2019;. As he writes (p111), &#x2018;A large part of our work with MP5 developing and supporting our students&#x2019; metacognition.&#x2019; We&#x2019;ve all had students that when asked, &#x2018;How did you know that?&#x2019; answer, &#x2018;With my brain&#x2019;! Helping students to recognise how they&#x2019;re actually thinking, in detail, is such a wonderful part of what we do, and Mike gives attention to this, with plenty of great examples and vignettes.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> I loved &#x2018;Are there any other foxy shapes?&#x2019; in chapter 6 (<i>Attend to precision</i>). On p133-6 three&#x2019;s a great vignette of how children play a game sorting shapes according to some property they&#x2019;ve chosen. (This would make a great development from a Which One Doesn&#x2019;t Belong!) One student&#x2019;s category is &#x2018;foxy shapes&#x2019; and the Socratic way in which the teacher shifts the children from a sort of holistic recognition of a fox-faced shape to themselves giving it a precise definition of essential properties is a delight.<br><br> I realised that I'm probably an MP 7 guy (of course all of them are important!) - someone that spends a lot of time in class getting students to explore and search for structure. I'd not seen such a complete list of the sorts of mathematical claims young students might make; is that kind of thing out there widely, because it should be? I do less problem-solving (learning to do more!) but focus on this lots.<br> I've merely touched on a few features of the book. There's so much more in there. It would be an excellent introduction to what's important in mathematics education for any beginning teacher of five to eight year olds. And an excellent tool for reflection for an experienced one too, bringing the focus back again and again to students' reasoning and discussion.<br><br> As Mike says, 'Enjoy these moments with your students and cherish the opportunities to learn alongside them, for this work is as engaging for us as it is for the students.'<br><br> Simon Gregg's Follow Learning Blog<br><br><p>An important thing to know about the Standards for Mathematical Practice is that they pertain across all levels of mathematical activity. These are K&#x2014;12 standards, but they describe the kinds of activity that distinguish math as a discipline.</p><p>When I wrote about the Standards for Mathematical Practice&nbsp;on this blog, and in&nbsp;the Dummies book, I took the easy way out. I addressed their spirit without going into all eight of them in depth.</p><p>But I&#x2019;m here today to tell you that&nbsp;Mike Flynn has taken the high road&nbsp;and done the much more challenging job of treating each of these standards right.</p><p>Flynn&nbsp;structured his book&nbsp;<i>Beyond Answers</i>&nbsp;around the Standards for Mathematical Practice&#x2014;one chapter per standard. He illustrates each with a vignette from his own life demonstrating the utility of the practice in his own daily life, with vignettes from classrooms, and with clear writing demonstrating the very real and important mathematical work&nbsp;of which young children are capable.</p><p>On its surface, this is a book about elementary children doing mathematics. But it&#x2019;s really a book about&nbsp;<i>people</i>&nbsp;doing mathematics. If you&#x2019;re a secondary or post-secondary teacher, and you read this book without seeing important connections to the work that you do, I&#x2019;ll buy you a cup of coffee so we can talk about that.</p><p>Ultimately, my own critique of the SMP was about them being too numerous to remember, and about them overlapping in ways that make it difficult to communicate their individual importance. I still have those critiques. Flynn doesn&#x2019;t convince me (nor does he try) that this is the perfect set of such standards. But he doesn&#x2019;t need to do that.</p><p>These are the standards we have. They resonate at all levels of mathematical activity, and in&nbsp;<i>Beyond Answers</i><i>,&nbsp;</i>Mike Flynn shows convincingly that young children&#x2019;s mathematical work is not fundamentally different from that of older students.

The language is spare and poetic, and many words and images will linger with readers, inspiring reflection and empathy: "The way the clouds slowly swam into view/reminded him of how things/can change/with a whisper." VERDICT A beautifully crafted story that's perfect for sharing aloud and discussing with a small group.&#x2014;Linda Ludke, London Public Library, Ont., Canada</p><h2>Earn It!

But her mom reminds her that most good things, like the garden they are growing, take time and work. At first, Bun isn&#x2019;t terribly excited by the idea of singing lessons and practice, but as she does the math and daydreams about her future singing career, the more she starts to like the idea of earning her way to stardom&#x2014;a feeling just as good as being rich and famous!</p><p><p><b>Cinders McLeod </b>(www.cindersmcleod.com) is the creator of the book and comic strip <i>Broomie Law</i>.

Bun, a young rabbit, earns carrots for helping her mother with household responsibilities and wants to become rich and famous by singing. But Bun's mother reminds her that bunnies don't get rich and famous overnight. It takes time and money, and the more you work at it, the better you will do. And after all that work, you will have earned your success, which is even better than being rich or famous. The cheery pencil and ink illustrations depict characters with large eyes and bursts of activity. Bun's obsession with being rich and famous is a bit unsettling, but her mother's gentle message about working hard is sound.

She is the author of the novels <i>We Are Called to Rise </i>and <i>In the Midnight Room</i>.We Are Called to Rise <br> <br>1<br> <br>Avis<br> <br>THERE WAS A YEAR of no desire. I don&#x2019;t know why. Margo said I was depressed; Jill thought it was &#x201c;the change.&#x201d; That phrase made me laugh. I didn&#x2019;t think I was depressed. I still grinned when I saw the roadrunner waiting to join me on my morning walk. I still stopped to look at the sky when fat clouds piled up against the blue, or in the evenings when it streaked orange and purple in the west. Those moments did not feel like depression.<br> <br>But I didn&#x2019;t desire my husband, and there was no certain reason for it, and as the months went by, the distance between us grew. I tried to talk myself out of this, but my body would not comply. Finally, I decided to rely on what in my case would be mother wisdom, or as Sharlene would say, &#x201c;to fake it till you make it.&#x201d;<br> <br>That night, I eased myself out of bed carefully, not wanting to fully wake Jim. I had grown up in Las Vegas, grown up seeing women prance around in sparkling underwear, learned how to do the same prancing in the same underwear when I was barely fifteen, but years of living in another Las Vegas, decades of being a suburban wife, a mother, a woman of a certain social standing, had left me uneasy with sequined bras and crotchless panties. My naughty-underwear drawer was still there&#x2014;the long narrow one on the left side of my dresser&#x2014;but I couldn&#x2019;t even remember the last time I had opened it. My heart skipped a little when I imagined slipping on a black lace corset and kneeling over Jim in bed. Well, I had made a decision, and I was going to do it. I would not give up on twenty-nine years of marriage without at least trying this.<br> <br>So I padded quietly over to the dresser, and eased open the narrow drawer. I was expecting the bits of lace and satin, even sequins, but nestled among them, obscenely, was a gun. It made me gasp. How had a gun gotten in this drawer?<br> <br>I recognized it, though. Jim had given it to me when Emily was a baby. He had insisted that I keep a gun. Because he traveled. Because someone might break in. I had tried to explain that I would never use it. I wouldn&#x2019;t aim a gun at someone any more than I would drown a kitten. There were decisions I had made about my life a long time ago; firing a gun was on that list. But there were things Jim could not hear me say, and in the end, it was easier just to accept the gun, just to let him hide it in one of those silly fake books on the third shelf of the closet, where, if I had thought about it&#x2014;and I never did&#x2014;I would have assumed it still was.<br> <br>How long had the gun been in this drawer? Had Jim put it there? Was he sending a message? Had Jim wanted to make the point that I hadn&#x2019;t looked in this drawer for years? Hadn&#x2019;t worn red-sequined panties in years? Had Jim been thinking the same way I had, that maybe what we needed was a little romance, a little fun, a little hot sex in the middle of the kitchen, in order to start over?<br> <br>I could hear Jim stirring behind me. He would be looking at me, naked in front of our sex drawer. Things weren&#x2019;t going exactly the way I had intended, but I shook my bottom a little, just to give him a hint at what I was doing.<br> <br>He coughed.<br> <br>I stopped then, not sure what that cough meant. I didn&#x2019;t even want to touch the gun, but I carefully eased the closest bit of satin out from under the barrel, still thinking that I would find a way to slip it on and maybe dance my way back to the bed.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in love with Darcy. We&#x2019;ve been seeing each other for a while.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was like the gun had gone off. There I was, naked, having just wagged my fifty-three-year-old ass, and there he was, somewhere behind me, knowing what I had been about to do, confessing to an affair with a woman in his office who was almost young enough to be our daughter.<br> <br>Was he confessing to an affair? Had he just said he was in love with her? The room melted around me. Something&#x2014;shock, humiliation, disbelief&#x2014;perhaps just the sudden image of Darcy&#x2019;s young bottom juxtaposed against the image I had of my own bottom in the hall mirror&#x2014;punched the air out of me.<br> <br>&#x201c;I wanted to tell you. I know I should have told you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Surely, this was not happening. Jim? Jim was having an affair with Darcy? (Or had he said he was in love?) Like the fragment of an old song, my mother&#x2019;s voice played in my mind. &#x201c;Always leave first, Avis. Get the hell out before they get the hell out on you.&#x201d; That was Sharlene&#x2019;s mantra: get the hell out first. She&#x2019;d even said it to me on my wedding day. It wasn&#x2019;t the least surprising that she&#x2019;d said it, but still, I had resented that comment for years. And, look, here she was: right. It took twenty-nine years. Two kids. A lot of pain. But Sharlene had been right.<br> <br>It all came rushing in then. Emily. And Nate. And the years with Sharlene. The hard years. The good years. Why Jim had seemed so distant. The shock of Jim&#x2019;s words, as I stood there, still naked, still with my back to my husband, my ass burning with shame, brought it all rushing in. So many feelings I had been trying not to feel. It seemed suddenly that the way I had been trying to explain things to myself&#x2014;the way I had pretended the coolness in my marriage was just a bad patch; the way I had kept rejecting the signs that something was wrong with Nate, that Nate had changed, that I was afraid for Nate (afraid of Nate?); the way that getting older bothered me, though I was trying not to care, trying not to notice that nobody noticed me, trying not to be anything like Sharlene&#x2014;it seemed suddenly that all of that, all of those emotions and all of that pretending, just came rushing toward me, a torpedo of shame and failure and fear. Jim was in love with Darcy. My son had come back from Iraq a different man. My crazy mother had been right. And my whole life, how hard I had tried, had come to this. I could not bear for Jim to see what I was feeling.<br> <br>How could I possibly turn around?<br> <br>I AM NINE YEARS OLD, and inspecting the bathtub before getting in. I ignore the brown gunk caked around the spigot, and the yellow tear-shaped stain spreading out from the drain; I can&#x2019;t do much about those. No, I am looking for anything that moves, and the seriousness with which I undertake this task masks the sound of my mother entering, a good hour before I expect her home from work.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yep. You sure have got the Briggs girl ass. That&#x2019;ll come in handy some day.&#x201d;<br> <br>She laughs, like she has said something funny. I am frustrated that my mother has walked in the bathroom without knocking, and I don&#x2019;t want to think about what she has just said. I step in the bathtub quick, bugs or not, and pull the plastic shower curtain closed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Should you be taking a bath? What if Rodney walked away?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I say, miffed that she is criticizing my babysitting skills. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s watching Gilligan&#x2019;s Island.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; she says, and I hear her move out of the bathroom and toward the kitchen. She is going to make a peanut butter and banana sandwich. Sharlene is twenty-seven years old, and she loves peanut butter and banana sandwiches.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;M SORRY, AVIS. I NEVER wanted to hurt you.&#x201d;<br> <br>I was still standing naked at the drawer, my back to Jim, the red satin fabric in my hand. I didn&#x2019;t know what to say to that. I couldn&#x2019;t seem to think straight, I couldn&#x2019;t seem to keep my mind on what was happening right that moment. Did Jim just say he was in love with Darcy? Why had I opened this drawer?<br> <br>And still I was racing toward Jim&#x2019;s apology, grateful for it, hopeful. One of the first things I ever knew about Jim was that he was willing to apologize.<br> <br>I AM TWENTY-ONE YEARS OLD, and working at the front desk of the Golden Nugget casino. It&#x2019;s taken years to get where I am, years to extricate myself from Sharlene, years to create the quiet, orderly life that means so much to me. That day, Jim is just one more man flirting with the front desk clerk, one more moderately drunk tourist wanting to know if I am free that evening; I barely register that he has said he will be back for a real conversation at four. And, of course, he is not back. But at ten to five, he rushes up, carrying a bar of chocolate, and tickets to Siegfried and Roy at the Frontier. I hear his very first apology.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I know you thought I wasn&#x2019;t serious, but I was. I couldn&#x2019;t get here at four. I was hitting numbers at the craps table, and if I&#x2019;d left, I would have caused a small riot. Please forgive me. You don&#x2019;t even have to go to the show with me. You can take a friend.&#x201d;<br> <br>That&#x2019;s how he apologized. All straightforward and a bit flustered and as if he meant it, as if I were someone who deserved better from him.<br> <br>I WAS WONDERING WHY THE gun was in the drawer. I was thinking that I would have to turn around. I was acutely aware of being naked. I didn&#x2019;t know which one of those problems to address first. Turning around. Being naked. Figuring out how the gun got in the drawer. And, of course, none of those were the real problem.<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean to fall in love with her. It just happened. We&#x2019;ve been spending a lot of time together at work. You&#x2019;ve been so distant. I don&#x2019;t know. I didn&#x2019;t plan it.&#x201d;<br> <br>He just kept talking. He seemed to think that I was listening. That he should talk. As if the fact that he didn&#x2019;t plan it could make it better. He said he was in love with her. Was that supposed to make me feel better? I wanted to get angry&#x2014;I wanted to grab at the lifeboat of anger&#x2014;but instead, my mind kept repeating&#x2014;cover your ass, where did the gun come from, always get the hell out first, did he say he was in love&#x2014;as if I were on some whirling psychotropic trip.<br> <br>I AM SEVEN YEARS OLD, and Sharlene and Rodney and I have been living in and out of Steve&#x2019;s brown Thunderbird for a year. We fill the tank with gas whenever my mom can pick someone&#x2019;s pocket or Steve can sell some dope, and then get back on the road, driving until we are almost out of gas, until Sharlene sees a place where we can camp without the cops catching us, where there is a park bathroom we can use if we are careful not to be seen. We have criss-crossed the country, even driven into Canada. That was a mistake, because the border patrol might have stopped us. But they didn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>The craziest thing about that year in Steve&#x2019;s car is that there are thousands of dollars crammed under the front seats. Steve has stolen the money, stolen it from a casino, and we are on the lam because he is afraid of getting killed, because he knows the owner of the casino will have him killed the instant he knows where he is, and Steve has decided the bills are marked, that the casino owner&#x2014;some guy Steve calls Big Sandy&#x2014;has written down the numbers on the bills and has banks looking for them. So he is afraid to spend any of it, not one dollar of it. Even when we are hungry, even when Rodney cries and cries because his ear hurts, Steve does not give in; he does not spend any of that cash, any of those bills. They sometimes waft up when the car&#x2019;s windows are open, and Rodney and I try to catch them, and Steve slams on the brakes and swerves the car and screams at us that not one bill can fly out the window.<br> <br>&#x201c;AVIS, I&#x2019;VE BEEN TRYING TO figure out how to tell you. I didn&#x2019;t mean for it to be like this. I didn&#x2019;t mean . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>His voice trailed off. He didn&#x2019;t mean for me to be stark naked and totally exposed when he told me? Then why had he told me?<br> <br>Oh, yeah, things were about to get awkward.<br> <br>Awkward if you were in love with your girlfriend.<br> <br>I lifted my hand to put the bit of satin back in the drawer, and I touched my fingers to the cold, hard metal of the gun barrel. I had never liked guns. I was afraid of them. Afraid of the people who had them.<br> <br>IT TAKES SHARLENE A LONG time, all of the year I might have been in second grade, but finally she has had enough. She waits until Steve is passed out stoned, and then she grabs huge fistfuls of the cash under the seats, and she grabs us&#x2014;I remember being grateful that she had grabbed us, that she had not left us with Steve&#x2014;and we walk to an all-night diner. We hitch a ride with a truck driver, and after Sharlene and the truck driver are done in the bed in the back of the cab, we get a real hotel room, and a shower. Sharlene stays in that shower until the water goes cold, and each time that the water warms up, she showers some more, and after a night and a day and a night of her showering&#x2014;with Rodney and me watching television sitting under the pebbled pink comforter, pretending it is a teepee, watching all through the day and the night, whatever shows come on&#x2014;after that, on the second day, we take a bus, and we are back in Las Vegas.<br> <br>&#x201c;WHY IS THERE A GUN in this drawer?&#x201d;<br> <br>It was the first thing I had said since Jim started talking. I realized it must have sounded incongruous. It was the only thing I could make my mouth say.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The gun. Our gun. It&#x2019;s in this drawer.&#x201d;<br> <br>I was still naked. My back was still to him.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. The gun?&#x201d;<br> <br>He sounded shaken. He was wondering if I had heard him. He didn&#x2019;t know what I was talking about.<br> <br>WE STAY IN A SHELTER when we first get back to Vegas, where I sleep on a cot near a man who burps rotgut whiskey and we line up for breakfast with a lady who screams that Betty Grable is trying to kill her. After a couple of nights, we move to a furnished motel where Sharlene can pay the rent weekly. That motel is not too far from the motel we lived in before Sharlene met Steve, though it is not the same one we lived in when Rodney was born, and it is not the same one we lived in when Sharlene first came to Vegas&#x2014;when Sharlene came to Vegas with me, just a baby, and the boyfriend who owned the 1951 Henry J. The Henry J broke down in Colorado, and Sharlene and I and the boyfriend had to hitchhike the rest of the way to Vegas. That&#x2019;s what Sharlene told me anyway, that&#x2019;s what I know about how I got to Vegas&#x2014;that, and that the Henry J was a red car without any way to get into the trunk.<br> <br>But they were mostly the same, those furnished motels. They all had rats, which didn&#x2019;t even scurry when I stamped my small foot, and mattresses stained with urine and vomit and blood. In all of them, the neon lights of dilapidated downtown casinos blinked through the kinked slats of broken window blinds.<br> <br>&#x201c;THIS GUN USED TO BE in the closet. Did you put it in this drawer?&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t know why I was asking these questions. I didn&#x2019;t care why the gun was in the drawer. I just had to say something, and nothing else that occurred to me to say was possible.<br> <br>&#x201c;I put it there. I forgot. I mean, I forgot until just now.&#x201d;<br> <br>I waited. Still naked. Was he still looking?<br> <br>&#x201c;It was a long time ago. At least a year. I had it out. I was looking at it. And you came in the room. I just wanted to put it away before you saw it. I meant to go back and get it, but I forgot about it. Until just now.&#x201d;<br> <br>I thought about this. The gun had been in the drawer for a year. Jim was looking at it. He didn&#x2019;t want me to see him looking at it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is it loaded?&#x201d;<br> <br>I heard Jim move, quickly. I almost laughed. I didn&#x2019;t know why I had asked if it was loaded, but I had no intention of shooting it. And suddenly, it was not funny. Did my husband just imagine that I would aim the gun at him? That I was asking him if it was loaded so that I could hurt him?<br> <br>What had happened to us?<br> <br>WE DIDN&#x2019;T STAY IN THAT furnished motel very long. Sharlene got the shakes. She said she couldn&#x2019;t be alone, not with Rodney and me anyway. So we went to live with a friend from the bar where Sharlene used to work. We lived there for fo...</p><h2>Tied (All Torn Up)</h2><p><b>Two hearts tied together by hope and tragedy.</b><br>My childhood and innocence were stolen when I was kidnapped at five years old and held captive for eleven years.

In a corner of Tuscany, one woman&#x2014;born in England, married&nbsp;to an Italian&#x2014;kept a record of daily life in a country at war. Iris Origo&#x2019;s powerful&nbsp;diary, <i>War in Val d&#x2019;Orcia</i>, is the spare and vivid account of what happened when&nbsp;a peaceful farming valley became a battleground.<br><br> At great personal risk, the Origos gave food and shelter to partisans, deserters, and&nbsp;refugees. They took in evacuees, and as the front drew closer they faced the knowledge&nbsp;that the lives of thirty-two small children depended on them. Origo writes&nbsp;with sensitivity and generosity, and a story emerges of human acts of heroism and&nbsp;compassion, and the devastation that war can bring.</p><p><b>Iris Origo </b>(1902&#x2013;1988) was a British-born biographer and writer.

The book was written over a hundred years ago, but because it is completely biblical, it is also completely timeless. However, to make the truths that it contains more accessible, the book&#x2019;s original language has been updated to make it more clearly understood by modern readers. Here is an excerpt. &#x201c;The Father waits to hear every prayer of faith, to give us what we determine, and what we ask in Jesus&#x2019; name. We have become so accustomed to limit the wonderful love and the large promises of our God that we cannot read the simplest and clearest statements of our Lord without the qualifying clauses by which we hedge them in and explain them away. If there is one thing I think the church needs to learn, it is that God intends for prayer to be answered, and that it has never entered the human mind what God will do for his child who devotes himself to believe that his prayer will be heard. God hears prayer. This is a universally acknowledged truth. But very few understand the meaning, or experience the power of it. If what I have written stirs my readers to read Jesus&#x2019; words, and take his amazing promises simply and literally as they are written, my objective will have been achieved.&#x201d; The book is written in 31 short chapters, making it perfect to use as devotional material.</p><p></p><h2>Chineasy Everyday: Learning Chinese Through Its Culture</h2><p><p>A unique and highly entertaining introduction to the richness of Chinese language, culture, and civilization, built on the groundbreaking and hugely popular Chineasy visual learning method.</p><p>To educate the world about the richness and character of China&#x2019;s people, customs, and heritage, entrepreneur ShaoLan Hsueh created Chineasy, a special building-block learning method that uses highly recognizable and appealing illustrations.

It is the oldest existing text on Japanese gardening&#x2014;or any kind of gardening&#x2014;in the world. In this edition of the <i>Sakuteiki,</i> the authors provide an English-language translation of this classic work and an introduction to the cultural and historical context that led to the development of Japanese gardening. Central to this explanation is an understanding of the sacred importance of stones in Japanese culture and Japanese garden design. <br><br>Written by a Japanese court noble during the Heian period (794-1184), the <i>Sakuteiki</i> includes both technical advice on gardening&#x2014;much of which is still followed in today's Japanese gardens&#x2014;and an examination of the four central threads of allegorical meaning, which were integral features of Heian-era garden design. For those seeking inspiration to build a rock garden or just better understand the Japanese stone garden, the <i>Sakuteiki</i> is an enduring classic.</p><p><b>Jiro Takei</b>, professor emeritus of the Kyoto College of Art, taught a course on the Sakuteiki for many years. Throughout his long and distinguished career, he has been deeply involved in the study of Japanese gardens, as the Chairman of the Japanese Garden Academic Society (Nihon Teien Gakkai), regional chief of the Gardening Academic Society (Zoen Gakkai), and chief researcher of the Research Center for Japanese Garden Art (Nihon Teien Kenkyu Senta).<br><br><b>Marc P.

Unfortunately, many people are drawn into relationships that are unfulfilling precisely because they are looking to other people to fill in the places where <i>they</i> are lacking--they are looking for a person who will "complete" them. At the heart of relationship dependency is a person's belief that he or she alone is not enough. But using others to provide wholeness simply does not work, because while we are made to be relationship dependent, it is God we must turn to in order to find wholeness.<br><br>In a warm, engaging style, Drs. Jantz and Clinton walk readers through patterns of relationship dependency, helping them unravel why they are drawn back to the same dry well of unfulfilled relationships over and over again. Readers will discover how to break the cycle, banish their fears, and find wholeness in the God who designed them to be in relationship first and foremost with him, thus freeing them to find healthy relationships with others. Includes a twelve-week personal recovery plan.</p><p><b>Do you fall into the same dead-end relationships time after time?<br><br>Are you still searching for that one person who will make you feel complete?<br><br>What if that's not actually what you need to feel happy and fulfilled?<br></b><br>When we look to other people to fill in the places where we are lacking, our relationships are virtually guaranteed to be unfulfilling. Because at the heart of this kind of relationship is a belief that alone we are <i>not enough</i>. Nothing could be further from the truth.<br><br>In a warm, engaging style, Drs. Jantz and Clinton help you unravel why you're drawn back to the same types of people and relationships over and over again.

Melina addresses the pressing adoption issues of today, such as open adoption, international adoption, and transracial adoption, and answers parents' most frequently asked questions, such as: </p> <ul> <li>How will my child "bond" or form attachments to me? </li> <li>When and how should I tell my child that he was adopted? </li> <li>What should schools be told about my child? </li> <li>Will adoption make adolescent upheavals more complicated? </li> </ul> <p> Up-to-date, sensitive, and clear, <i>Raising Adopted Children</i> is the definitive resource for all adoptive parents and concerned professionals. </p></p><p>"Some people may describe adoption as <i>difficult</i>; others simply describe it as <i>different</i>. I am inclined to think of it as complex," writes Lois Ruskai Melina in the updated, revised <i>Raising Adopted Children: Practical, Reassuring Advice for Every Adoptive Parent</i>.<p> Adoption practices have evolved considerably since this book's first publication in 1986, and the new version of the "Dr. Spock for adoptive parents" reflects the latest theories. Drawing on the findings and practices of pediatricians, social workers, scientists, and adoptive parents, <i>Raising Adopted Children</i> is carefully and thoroughly researched. Chapters on open adoption, international adoption, and transracial adoption are combined with advice on bonding and attachment, breast-feeding an adoptive infant (possible but complicated), dealing with schools, privacy issues, adopting a child with disabilities, adopting as a single parent, and the challenges of adolescence. While Melina's many years of professional and personal experience shape her advice, she remains very evenhanded. For example, she's a strong proponent of the "early telling" theory of adoption (being open about the adoption with the child from the beginning), but she also clearly presents other points of view, and, throughout the book, encourages parents to make decisions that feel right for them. </p><p> The text includes specific suggestions for explaining a child's birth circumstances, including common misconceptions, and a valuable discussion about whether adoptees are at greater risk for behavior problems or learning disabilities. She also provides suggestions for setting rules for contact with biological parents, easing grief, and acknowledging a child's history. A completely annotated list of selected references and resources rounds out this superior guide. <i>--Ericka Lutz</i></p><p>Lois Ruskai Melina is the editor of <em>Adopted Child</em> newsletter and serves on the board of directors of the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute, an organization dedicated to improving the quality of information about adoption and providing guidance for practice and policy change in the field. Melina speaks frequently about adoption to professional organizations and adoptive parents throughout the United States, Canada, and Australia. She is the author of <em>Making Sense of Adoption</em> and the coauthor of <em>The Open Adoption Experience</em>.</p></p><h2>Mice on Ice (I Like to Read)</h2><p>Thought-provoking visual illusions and characters that are bright, bold, and original accompany a text that is pleasing to the ear yet just right for the newest reader.

A group of colorful mice discovers an ice rink and have fun swirling and whirling around. The little creatures take a break from their skating and look down to see the pattern their skates have made and realize that it looks like a cat.

He drove between the posts and onto the forest-flanked lane, driving too quickly over the bumps and ruts.<br><br>Lacey pressed her palm against the dashboard for balance. Although it was only dusk, it was already dark along the tree-shrouded gravel lane leading to the Kiss River light station. "You'd better slow down," she said. "I nearly ran over an opossum on this road last night."<br><br>Obediently, Tom lifted his foot from the gas pedal. "I'm glad you don't live out here alone," he said in the paternal tone he occasionally used with her since learning he was her biological father a decade ago. "I'd be worried about you all the time."<br><br>"Well," Lacey sighed. "I won't be living out here too much longer." The Coast Guard had finally decided to turn the nearly restored keeper's house into a museum, a decision she had hoped would never come.<br><br>"You're upset about it, huh?"<br><br>"Oh, a bit." She was frankly scared, although of what, she couldn't say. The isolation the keeper's house had offered her had been more than welcome, it had been necessary, especially this last difficult year. "They've restored every inch of it except the living room and the sunroom." She shared a studio in Kill Devil Hills with Tom, but she'd turned the sunroom of the keeper's house into a small studio, as well, so she could work on her stained glass when she was at home. "They'll restore the sunroom after I leave, and the living room will be turned into a little shop and information area."<br><br>"When do they want you out?" he asked. They were nearing the end of the road. A bit of dusky daylight broke through the trees and she could clearly see the gray in Tom's wiry blond ponytail and the glint of light from the small gold hoop in his ear.<br><br>"Some time after the first of the year," she said.<br><br>"Where will you...holy shit." Tom had driven from the gravel road into the parking lot, and the keeper's house came into view in the evening light. The upper portions of nearly every window were aglow with her stained glass creations.<br><br>She followed his gaze to the house. "In the year and a half I've lived here, you haven't seen the keeper's house at night?" she asked.<br><br>Tom stopped the car in the middle of the lot and a smile came slowly to his lips. Shaking his head, he leaned over to pull Lacey toward him, wrapping her in the scent of tobacco as he kissed the top of her head. She had gotten him to stop drinking, but had failed at getting him to give up cigarettes.<br><br>"You're your mother, Lace," he said. "This is just the sort of thing she would do. Turn her home into a...I don't know. Someplace magical."<br><br>She felt defeated. She wanted to tell him that she was not her mother any longer, that she had worked hard this last year to rid herself of her mother's persona. Apparently she had not succeeded. It was hard to succeed when you had no identity of your own to take the place of the one you were trying to discard.<br><br>She was surprised to see her father's van parked in the lot next to Clay's Jeep. "Dad is here," she said. "Weird."<br><br>"He doesn't come to visit you much?" Tom asked, and she heard the competitive edge in his voice. Tom often displayed a quiet envy of Alec O'Neill for having had the honor of raising her.<br><br>"He's smitten with Rani," she said, not really answering the question. "He likes having a grandbaby."<br><br>Tom laughed. "You have one hell of a complicated family, you know that?"<br><br>"I do, indeed." Lacey unfastened her seat belt. The tight little nuclear family she'd grown up in had added and subtracted so many people that it sometimes seemed difficult to keep track of them all. To complicate her life even further, she worked with both her fathers, spending her mornings in the animal hospital run by the father who had raised her and her afternoons in the art studio with the father who had given her life.<br><br>"Is that a kennel?" Tom pointed toward the large fenced area near the edge of the woods. "Is Clay training dogs again?"<br><br>"Uh-huh," she said. "He's been back at it a few months now." With Gina and Rani in his life, her brother had undergone a metamorphosis. He was a devoted husband, and practically overnight, he'd developed parenting skills she had never expected to see in him. But it was the day she'd watched him roll chunks of wood and concrete into the forest&#x2014;obstacles for the dogs he trained in search-and-rescue work&#x2014;that she knew he was once again a man at peace with his world.<br><br>She realized that Tom had not moved his car from the center of the lot.<br><br>"Park your car and come in for a while," she said.<br><br>He shook his head. "No, I'll just head on home."<br><br>"You know you're welcome," she said.<br><br>"I know that, sugar. But...I just never feel comfortable around Alec. Your dad."<br><br>Lacey smiled. "I'm nearly twenty-six years old, Tom," she said. "What happened between you and my mother is ancient history and you know my father got over it a long time ago."<br><br>"Some other time," Tom said.<br><br>"Okay." She opened the car door and stepped out. "I'll see you tomorrow."<br><br>She waved as he turned the car around and drove back onto the gravel lane. Slipping off her sandals, she dangled them over her fingertips and started walking across the sand toward the house. The air was thick with salt, and the rhythmic pounding of the waves against the shore was nearly drowned out by the buzz of cicadas.<br><br>She often wondered if she should tell Tom the truth about her mother. It was clear that he thought he had been her only affair, as if he alone had been so irresistible that he could cause a woman as saintly as Annie O'Neill to stray. As far as Lacey knew, he did not date anyone, still so haunted by Annie's ghost that he thought it impossible to find a woman who could take her place. Yet Lacey couldn't bring herself to hurt him with the truth.<br><br>Inside the house, Clay's black lab, Sasha, ran into the kitchen to greet her, and she dropped her sandals on the floor and bent down to scratch the dog behind his ears. The room smelled of Gina's cooking&#x2014;cardamom and turmeric, coconut and ginger. She could hear voices coming from the living room.<br><br>"Who's here, Sash?" she said, as if she didn't know. "Let's go see."<br><br>Sasha led the way through the kitchen to the living room, tail wagging, and Lacey stopped in the doorway of the room, not wanting to interrupt the scene in front of her. Gina was stretched out on the sofa, grinning, her arms folded behind her head as she watched Clay and Alec playing on the floor with Rani and her dolls. Clay was making the Indian Barbie, which was bedecked in a pink sari, walk across the rug toward the plastic dollhouse.<br><br>"Let's go to Rani's house!" he said in a high-pitched voice.<br><br>Alec was walking a brown-skinned baby doll&#x2014;a big blob of a doll compared to the slender, shapely Barbie&#x2014;around on the carpet. "No," he said. "I want to go fishing!"<br><br>Rani looked alarmed, reaching for the baby doll. "No, no, no!" she said, her enormous black eyes wide in her caramel-colored face. "Everyone comes to <em>my</em> house."<br><br>Lacey laughed. At nearly two and a half, Rani tried hard to control her world. She'd had so little opportunity to control it during her first two years that she was making up for lost time. The little girl looked up at the sound of Lacey's laughter, then jumped up from the floor.<br><br>"Lacey!" she said, running toward her. "I love you!"<br><br>Lacey bent down to pick her up. She was a little peanut of a child. So tiny. So full ofjoy. And so, so wanted.<br><br>"Hi, baby," Lacey said. "I love you, too."<br><br>Gina had struggled to adopt Rani, and once Clay had fallen in love with Gina, he had joined that struggle with his whole heart. They'd spent from July to September in India the year before, fighting the system to get the court's permission to adopt Rani. The little girl had desperately needed heart surgery, but so many obstacles stood in the way of the adoption that Gina had feared the toddler might die before she could bring her home. Once permission had been received, the three of them were quickly ushered out of the country, escaping before the foreign adoption antagonists could become involved. By that time, Rani was so weak from her heart condition that she could barely hold her head up, and Gina and Clay feared it might be too late to save her. Gina had already made contact with a surgeon in Seattle, so she flew there with Rani. The surgery was successful and the two of them remained in Seattle as Rani healed. Clay had moped around the keeper's house, unable to think of anything other than the woman and baby he had fallen in love with. He and Gina talked for hours on the phone&#x2014;for so long, in fact, that Lacey had insisted he get a separate phone line installed in the keeper's house. In February, Gina and Rani traveled across the country to the Outer Banks. Gina and Clay were married the following day, and Rani, who had arrived shy and quiet and skinny as a twig, quickly blossomed into an insatiable chatterbox who fully recognized her role as the center of the universe. She was spoiled&#x2014;if it was possible to spoil a child who had spent her first two years with little more than dirt and deprivation&#x2014;and no one cared.<br><br>Lacey carried Rani over to the sofa and sat down next to Gina's bare feet. She looked at her father, who still sat on the floor, holding the fat baby doll on his lap. "What are you doing here, Dad?" she asked.<br><br>Alec set the doll down on the rug and leaned back on his hands. "I wanted to talk to you and Clay," he said. His serious tone was worrisome. She looked from her father to Clay, who shrugged, apparently as much in the dark as she was. The two men looked so much alike. Long, lanky bodies, translucent blue eyes. The only difference between them were the lines on her father's face and the gray in his hair. Clay could look at Alec O'Neill and know exactly how he, himself, would look in another twenty years.<br><br>Gina sat up and reached for Rani. "I'll put her to bed," she said, as if knowing this conversation was meant for Alec and his children and not necessarily for her.<br><br>"Good night, sweetie." Lacey planted a kiss on Rani's cheek before handing her over to Gina.<br><br>Her father stood up as Gina left the room. "Let's go outside," he said.<br><br>She and Clay followed him through the kitchen, down the porch steps and onto the sand, which felt cool now beneath her feet. In another few weeks the sand would be warm, even at night, never losing the heat from the day. As if on automatic pilot, the three of them started walking side by side toward the remains of the lighthouse. Illuminated by the half-moon, the white lighthouse glowed, its broken rim a ragged line across the night sky. A breeze had kicked up in the short time she'd been inside the house, and Lacey's long, wild hair blew across her face. If she'd known about the change in weather, she would have tied her hair back before stepping outside. People thought her hair was impossibly beautiful. She thought it was merely impossible.<br><br>"What's up, Dad?" Clay asked, and Lacey wondered if he, too, was remembering the last time their father had asked to speak to both of them, the day he told them that their mother had been unfaithful to him throughout their marriage.<br><br>"I received a letter today," their father said. "I forgot to bring it with me for you two to read it, but essentially it stated that a parole hearing is scheduled in September for Zachary Pointer."<br><br>Clay stopped walking and turned to face his father. <em>"Parole?"</em> He sounded as astonished as she felt. "He's only been in prison...what?...twelve years?"<br><br>"Apparently that's long enough to get him out on parole."<br><br>Lacey caught her hair in her hands and began to braid it down her back, concentrating hard on the task. She didn't want to think about Zachary Pointer or relive that night, although the memory was always so near the surface that just the mention of his name would bring it back. Nothing could prevent her from remembering his face, the crazed look in his wild eyes. She could still hear his angry and ugly words toward his wife and see her mother's noble&#x2014;and successful&#x2014;attempt to protect the woman.<br><br>Lacey had refused to attend the trial back then; in those days she could focus on nothing other than trying to survive the pain of losing her mother. But once and only once, before she realized what she was looking at and could turn away, she saw Pointer on television. The big man was leaving the courthouse with his lawyer. She'd been riveted by the sight of him. He wept when he spoke to the reporters. She'd been struck by the humanness in his face, by the unmistakable remorse and sorrow and shame she saw there. Now she pictured him in prison all this time, alone with the pain of that remorse. He'd been sick. Mentally ill. There'd been no doubt in her mind, but the jury had adamantly ruled against an insanity plea. Maybe she and Clay and their father <em>should</em> listen to the arguments for allowing him out on parole. Twelve years was a long time.<br><br><em>Stop it,</em> she thought to herself. She had her mother's genes, whether she wanted them or not; she was doomed to feel compassion for everyone.<br><br>"He should have been fried," she said, the words so alien coming from her mouth that her brother and father both turned to stare at her.<br><br>"Well, we're in agreement then," her father said after a moment. "We'll fight his parole. I'll hire an attorney to find out what our next step should be."<br><br></p><h2>Great American Songbook: Singers</h2><p>(Piano/Vocal/Guitar Songbook).

The products and tools needed are accessible to all: FX, a margin account, CFDs, spread-bets and futures. <br><br>But this level playing field comes with great risks. Trading with leverage is inherently dangerous. With leverage, losses and costs &#x2013; the two great killers for traders &#x2013; are magnified. <br><br>This does not mean leverage must be avoided altogether, but it does mean that it needs to be used safely. In Leveraged Trading, Robert Carver shows you how to do exactly that, by using a trading system. A trading system can be employed to tackle those twin dangers of serious losses and high costs. <br><br>The trading systems introduced in this book are simple and carefully designed to use the correct amount of leverage and trade at a suitable frequency. Rob shows how to trade a simple Starter System on its own, on a single instrument and with a single rule for opening positions. <br><br>He then moves on to show how the Starter System can be adapted, as you gain experience and confidence. The system can be diversified into multiple instruments and new trading rules can be added. For those who wish to go further still, advice on making more complex improvements is included: how to develop your own trading systems, and how to combine a system with your own human judgement, an approach Robert has nicknamed Semi-Automatic Trading. <br><br>For those trading with leverage, looking for a way to take a controlled approach and manage risk, a properly designed trading system is the answer. Pick up Leveraged Trading and learn how.</p><p>Robert Carver is an independent investor, trader and writer.

These near-death experiencers were everyday people from all over the world&#x2014;many of whom were clinically dead, unable to see or hear, and yet able to perceive new vistas of a world beyond the senses and even beyond death.</p><p><i>The Self Does Not Die</i> is a trailblazing effort to present the most confirmed cases of consciousness beyond death ever compiled. In these cases, the authors have gone back to the original sources, the people involved in each case, whenever possible, rather than relying on secondhand sources. In so doing, they have assembled a unique collection of empirical data that any scholar worthy of the name must take into account.</p><p>By carefully studying and describing many convincing and corroborated cases, during cardiac arrest and other cases, the authors conclude that there are good reasons to assume that our consciousness does not always coincide with the functioning of our brain: Enhanced consciousness can sometimes be experienced separately from the body.</p><p>This book is a <i>must read</i> for anyone wanting to know more about this fascinating subject with its implications about the very nature of human consciousness and its survival of physical death.

Ellis grew up in the poor white section of Durham, North Carolina, and as a young man joined the Ku Klux Klan. Ann Atwater, a single mother from the poor black part of town, quit her job as a household domestic to join the civil rights fight. During the 1960s, as the country struggled with the explosive issue of race, Ellis and Atwater met on opposite sides of the public school integration issue. Their encounters were charged with hatred and suspicion. In an amazing set of transformations, however, each of them came to see how the other had been exploited by the South's rigid power structure, and they forged a friendship that flourished against a backdrop of unrelenting bigotry.<br><br>Now a major motion picture, <i>The Best of Enemies</i> offers a vivid portrait of a relationship that defied all odds.

Cancer rates continue to rise. There is an epidemic of chronic disease in children. Even with all the money and modern innovations in science, the country&#x2019;s health care system is beyond broken. Clearly there is a glitch in the system. But what if the solution has been here all along, and we&#x2019;ve just been too blind to see it?</p> <p>In <em>Curable</em> journalist and health care advocate Travis Christofferson looks at medicine through a magnifying glass and asks an important question: What if the roots of the current US health care crisis are psychological and systemic, perpetuated not just by corporate influence and the powers that be, but by you and me? It is now known that human perception is based on deeply entrenched patterns of irrational thought, which we attach ourselves to religiously. So how does this implicate the very scientific research and data that doctors rely on to successfully treat their patients?</p> <p>A page-turning inquiry into a &#x201c;moneyball approach to medicine,&#x201d; <em>Curable </em>explores the links between revolutionary baseball analytics; Nobel Prize&#x2013;winning psychological research on confirmation bias; wildly successful maverick economic philosophy; the history of the radical mastectomy and the rise of the clinical trial; cutting edge treatments routinely overlooked by regulatory bodies; and outdated medical models that prioritize profit over prevention. As stark as things are, Christofferson asks us to see health care not as a toppling house of cards, but as a badly organized system that is inherently fixable. How do we fix it? First we must reframe the conflict between doctors&#x2019; intuition and statistical data. Then we must design better systems that can support doctors who are increasingly overwhelmed with the complexity of modern medicine.</p> <p><em>Curable</em> outlines the future of medicine, detailing brilliant examples of new health care systems that prove we can do better. It turns out we have more control over our health (and happiness) than we think.</p></p><p><p>Travis Christofferson, MS, is the author of <em>Curable</em> and&nbsp; <em>Tripping Over the Truth</em> and received his undergraduate degree in molecular biology from the Honors College at Montana State University and a master&#x2019;s degree in material engineering and science from the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. Today he is a full-time science writer and founder of a cancer charity. He lives in South Dakota.</p><p>&#x201c;Travis Christofferson provides a compelling strategy for curing our broken health care system based on &#x2018;moneyball&#x2019; logic, common sense, and validated science. Why is the logic and science supporting this strategy ignored? Every member of our society should address the questions posed in <em>Curable</em>, especially those in the health care industry and in the US congress.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Thomas N. Seyfried, PhD, author of <em>Cancer as a Metabolic Disease</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;We cannot expect the health care industry to change on its own. We have to take ownership of our own choices, look at the research with a critical eye, and compel the change that we so desperately need. Nobody provides the evidence-based rallying cry like Travis Christofferson, and <em>Curable</em> is a perfect blueprint for some of the ways we can start to make real improvements to the health of our nation, now.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Aubrey Marcus, CEO, Onnit; <em>New York Times </em>best-selling author of <em>Own the Day, Own Your Life</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Travis Christofferson&#x2019;s highly anticipated new book does not disappoint. Our current medical system (I find it difficult to call it &#x2018;health&#x2019; care) is defective, and <em>Curable</em> goes into great detail as to why and offers an intelligent approach to the future of medicine. A growing number of doctors are finding ways to support their patient outcomes by repurposing drugs as well as changing their thinking in order to approach the challenge of chronic illness with entirely new methods. However, with the average clinical study costing millions of dollars and taking 17 years to go from bench to bedside, patients often don&#x2019;t have the luxury of time nor the financial resources to utilize these expensive treatments. Christofferson encourages us to look beyond the dogma and leads us down an entirely new path. I anticipate this book will be an important wake up call for physicians, patients, and biotechnicians to come together and return &#x2018;health&#x2019; to health care.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Dr. Nasha Winters, coauthor of <em>The Metabolic Approach to Cancer</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<em>Curable</em> is exceptionally well written, captivating, and convincing. It&#x2019;s true that the existing problem with health care is psychological and systemic, and there are numerous examples and stories to support this. Travis Christofferson advances the idea of repurposing drugs in innovative ways, which has the potential to revolutionize a profit-driven and incompetent health care system. The off-label use of generic drugs can be highly efficacious and an adjuvant to augment existing therapies. For examples, see the recent studies on the use of metformin for cancer or the use of ketamine for drug-resistant depression. There are many ideas presented in this book that are incredibly important for researchers, health care professionals, and educators to understand and disseminate. <em>Curable</em> is incredibly informative, and I will be sure to recommend it to all my colleagues and students.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Dominic D&#x2019;Agostino, PhD, associate professor, USF Morsani College of Medicine</strong></p><br><br><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;Travis Christofferson elegantly details why and how Western medicine is failing us and, more importantly, gives us a road map for recovery. We already have the tools of the trade to change direction, we simply need a new driver to effect those changes. <em>Curable</em> helps to properly inform those that wish to take control of their health to identify interventions that are biologically plausible and which have a proper scientific basis. These are time-tested therapies with minimal side effects and maximal outcomes that can give us all the power to change direction. As Lao Tzu said, &#x2018;If you do not change direction, you may end up where you are heading.&#x2019; Read this book and steer yourself back to good health.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Dr. Sarah Myhill, author of <em>Sustainable Medicine</em> and <em>Diagnosis and Treatment of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Myalgic Encephalitis</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Travis Christofferson seamlessly weaves together psychology, medicine, history, and insight in this page-turning book, providing a compelling case for improving the quality of life of patients in efficient and effective ways. Christofferson has an exceptional ability to synthesize the work of others, and in <em>Curable </em>he brings it all together in a gripping narrative that&#x2019;s both informative and entertaining.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Bob Kaplan, MS, MBA, medical research analyst</strong></p></p><h2>Mapping the World: A Mapping and Coloring Book of World History, Volume Two: Since 1300</h2><p>This two-volume workbook includes approximately thirty-five reference maps and fifty outline maps that provide opportunities to deepen understanding of world history through coloring exercises.<br></p><p><br><strong>Bonnie G.

Easwaran presents them systematically, and practically, as a way to explore deeper and deeper levels of personality, and to answer the age-old question, &#x201c;Who am I?&#x201d;<br><br> Easwaran grew up in India, learned Sanskrit from a young age, and became a professor of English literature before coming to the West. His translation of <i>The Upanishads</i> is the best-selling edition in English.<br><br> For students of philosophy and of Indian spirituality, and readers of wisdom literature everywhere, Easwaran&#x2019;s interpretation of this classic helps us in our own quest into the meaning of our lives.</p><p>&#34;These old stories are our own, as relevant today as ever. Myth always involves the listener. We identify with its heroes; their crises mirror ours. Their stories remind us not only of what the scriptures mean but why they matter. Like the texts themselves, they seek a response in our own lives.&#34;<i>"Get up! Wake up! Seek the guidance of an illumined teacher and realize the Self. Sharp like a razor's edge, the sages say, is the path, difficult to traverse." </i>- Katha Upanishad<br><br>Eknath Easwaran is the author of the best-selling translation of the ancient wisdom texts called the Upanishads. Here he shows how one powerful Upanishad, the Katha, embraces all the key ideas of Indian mysticism and presents them in the context of a mythic story we can all relate to - the story of a young hero who ventures into the land of death in search of immortality.<br><br>But the insights of the Katha, as with all the Upanishads, are scattered, hard to understand. Easwaran presents them systematically, and practically, as a way to explore deeper and deeper levels of personality.

When your body becomes either too acidic or too alkaline, you become susceptible to a host of disorders. &nbsp;When balance is restored, however, so is your health. &nbsp;In this brilliant book, renowned health expert Alex Guerrero explains how you can become well &#x2015; now and for an extended lifetime &#x2015; by restoring your pH balance. &nbsp;The author first describes how you can assess your health. &nbsp;He then provides a plan, including a fourteen-day diet and a simple program of supplements, that will bring your body back into balance. &nbsp;You&#x2019;ll even find a selection of recipes that will tempt your taste buds as you reclaim your health and well-being.</p> <p>Here is a book that will quickly capture the imagination of all those looking for a drug-free way to feel better.&nbsp;<strong><i>In Balance for Life</i></strong>&nbsp;offers an effective, easy-to-follow program that is bound to shake up your beliefs about your own body, and about the steps you can take to maintain or regain your well-being.</p></p><p><i>Alex Guerrero</i> received his degree in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) from SAMRA University in Los Angeles, California. &nbsp;In 1996, Alex opened a successful practice in Los Angeles, which centers on sports injury, rehabilitation, performance enhancement, and nutrition. &nbsp;Alex works with professional and world-class athletes. &nbsp;A partial list of his clients includes LaDainian Tomlinson and Keenan McCardell of the San Diego Chargers, and Ty Law and Willie McGinest of the New England Patriots. &nbsp;He is also a consultant for numerous NFL and collegiate teams. &nbsp;In addition, Alex is a highly popular speaker and a frequent guest on television and radio shows. &nbsp;He and his family currently reside in the greater Los Angeles area.<p>Introduction</p> <p>Today, it is practically impossible to go anywhere without hearing about how our country is facing a health crisis of major proportions&#x2015;the prices of drugs are skyrocketing; millions of citizens go without health insurance; and a third of our population already suffers from some form of degenerative disease. While our politicians, economists, and health experts argue about how best to face this problem, few, if any, seem to have any realistic long-term solution.</p> <p>There is, however, an answer. It is a solution that isn&#x2019;t complicated, doesn&#x2019;t require billions of tax dollars, and doesn&#x2019;t need a giant bureaucratic overseer. The answer is . . . good health. If fewer people needed pills to lower blood pressure, decrease cholesterol levels, or stimulate their love lives, think about the impact it would have on our health-care system. If fewer people suffered from the severe pain of arthritis, rheumatism, and other degenerative diseases, think how much emptier doctors&#x2019; offices would be. And if the incidence of cancer started to drop sharply, consider how much less sorrow and grief there would be in our lives.</p> <p>The sad truth is that health is something the majority of people in this country are lacking. The incidence of chronic illness is at an all-time high. Just as alarming, even among people who don&#x2019;t have any obvious symptoms of disease, lack of energy seems to be epidemic. Certainly, it is the number-one complaint among my clients, as well as the clients of my colleagues. Yet, paradoxically, at no time in history has such a wealth of health information been available to us, as evidenced by the abundant supply of books, newsletters, magazines, seminars, and websites all devoted to providing health information. So why are we so unhealthy as a nation? And, more importantly, what can be done about it?</p> <p>That&#x2019;s what this book is all about. I wrote it to answer these questions, and to empower you with all the information you need to reclaim and maintain your health and vitality, now and for the rest of your life. After years of careful research, study, and observation, I can say with absolute confidence that the solution to this country&#x2019;s &nbsp;health problems does exist and that it can be summarized in one word&#x2015;Balance!</p> <p>Our bodies are designed to be healthy. This is a scientific fact. Regardless of your current state of health, if you follow my easy-to-use system for restoring and maintaining the balance your body requires for optimal health, I guarantee that you will experience a noticeable difference in how you feel. This is a bold claim, to be sure, but I make it with confidence, because each day, I witness how clients suffering from every conceivable malady experience dramatic improvements in their health after implementing the very principles you will discover in this book. Even if you are already healthy, these principles can help you, just as they have helped the world-class and professional athletes who consult me every day.</p> <p>In the pages that follow, you will learn not only how your body works, but also how you can begin to move it from a state of degeneration and fatigue to a state of regeneration and vitality. You will also learn about the number-one key for doing so&#x2015;proper acid-alkaline balance, also known as the pH Factor.</p> <p>The information I will be sharing with you is not new. In fact, the principles that support it have been scientifically verified time and time again by researchers throughout the world. For the most part, however, they remain all but ignored by conventional and alternative health-care providers alike. As a result, our society is increasingly burdened with health-care problems.</p> <p>Fortunately, the principles presented in this book are easy to understand, and even easier to implement. By applying them to your daily life, you will be taking back control of your health and starting down the road to optimal vitality. No matter what health challenge you may presently be facing, you can increase your well-being by adopting the guidelines that follow. This is my message to you: You don&#x2019;t have to be sick!</p> <p>In the chapters that follow, you will learn:</p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The full extent of our nation&#x2019;s health-care crisis, and the primary factors that contribute to it.</p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The absolute essentials for achieving excellent health, and the means by which you can easily ensure that they become part of your daily life.</p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The important role that the pH Factor plays in health and overall balance of the body; the reason that this role is misunderstood or ignored by most health-care practitioners; and the reason why unhealthy pH levels&#x2015;a disruption of proper acid-alkaline balance&#x2015;are at the root of all disease conditions.</p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why the foods you eat are the key to good health, and how you can take charge of your health by knowing what foods to eat, how you should prepare these foods, and exactly when these foods should be consumed.</p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The nutritional supplement program that will take your health to the next level.</p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My 14-Day Diet Plan to quick-start your journey to vibrant vitality.</p> <p>If you are ready to reclaim your health, turn the page and read on.</p></p><h2>Forget Me Knot (A Quilting Mystery)</h2><p><i>Welcome to San Fernando Valley, California, where Martha Rose and her coterie of quilters are enjoying life on the good side of retirement--until murder pulls a stitch out of their plans. . .</i><br><br>Martha and her besties Lucy and Birdie are set to expand their Quilty Tuesdays by inviting newcomer Claire Terry into their group.

It's built, instead, mostly on the Old Testament, Church culture, and Paganism. It is therefore imperative that we as God's people dare to stop and take a closer look at the Church today and compare it to the first Church we read about in the Bible. If we are to succeed in making disciples of all nations then we must go back to the "template" we find in the Bible. Let the reformation begin!</p></p><p>Torben S�ndergaard lives in Denmark with his wife, Lene, and their three children. Torben grew up in a non-Christian family. On April 5, 1995, after attending a church service with a friend, he turned to God and had a strong, personal encounter with Jesus that totally changed his life. Five years later, from a Scripture in the Bible and in a sort of desperation after more of God, Torben started on a 40-day fast that transformed many things in his life. His eyes were more open to God&#39;s Word and what the gospel is about. He began to understand how lukewarm and far away from the truth Christians had become. He saw that God had called him to speak His Word without compromise. Torben has seen many people saved, healed, and set free from demons. He has written seven books and is the founder of the mission organization, The Last Reformation. He is known for having a direct approach to the Bible and for his personal life with God. Many know him from national Danish TV, where he has appeared many times, or they know him from his videos on YouTube.com.

This book invites the reader to understand their role in the problem of human trafficking, but more importantly, their role in the solution.<br> &nbsp;<br> Human trafficking can be defined as the exploitation of vulnerability for commercial gain.&nbsp;Using the power of story and candid interviews, Sadler seeks to discover how ordinary people can fight human trafficking by recognizing vulnerability and entering in.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> As vulnerable people, we can empower other vulnerable people, because Christ was made vulnerable for us.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Raleigh&nbsp;Sadler&nbsp;</b>speaks and writes on the topics of vulnerability and human trafficking.

A timely book for this hour."<br><b>Christine Caine, founder, The A21 Campaign </b><br><br> "C. S. Lewis once described Christianity as &#x201c;a fighting religion.&#x201d; Those who are serious about following Christ into the world will also be serious about fighting against what is wrong in the world, especially where injustice and abuse are the norm. As the father of two girls, I am especially appreciative of Raleigh&#x2019;s efforts in <i>Vulnerable</i>, which is a sort of roadmap for fighting for the hearts of, and fighting against the oppression of, girls and women who are potential or real victims of the sex trade. Much of the content and stories in this book are unsettling . . . and purposefully so. For when our hearts are unsettled, we are moved to action. I pray that Vulnerable will impact you and your community in this way."<br><b>Scott Sauls, senior pastor of Christ Presbyterian Church in Nashville, Tennessee, and author of <i>Befriend</i> and<i> Irresistible Faith </i></b><br><br> "God has called Christians to come alongside and advocate for the most marginalized in our society. Today as we speak, there are thousands in our communities who have been trafficked against their will, whose lives are not viewed as valuable, but as property for the powerful. To engage in this important work of justice, Christians must be biblical in their thinking. This book helps unpack what it means to both fight for the vulnerable and realize our own vulnerability, how in our weakness, we find the strength to step into the mission of God. I urge you to thoroughly read this book, to let it shape your approach to activism, and then pass it on to a brother or sister in Christ."&nbsp;<br><b>Dan Darling, vice president for Communications for the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission and author of <i>The Dignity Revolution</i></b><br><br> "The church is at its best, and is living out the redemptive realities of the gospel most fully, when it is running toward the vulnerable and broken with truth, hope, and grace, rather than remaining in safety and comfort.

Trafficking is modern day slavery and is the fastest growing criminal industry in the world. The stories and statistics can be overwhelming. The Bible does not hesitate to depict the harsh reality of violence and oppression, and it clearly calls us to fight for justice and mercy for all people as God intended. But what can an ordinary person do to respond? In Vulnerable, Raleigh offers wisdom and hope as well as tangible responses to fight trafficking."<br><b>Justin S. Holcomb, Episcopal priest, seminary professor, and author</b><br><br> "This book is both a passionate call for help and a handhold for where to start. Before reading <i>Vulnerable</i> the gap between my everyday life and those who are being exploited seemed, if I&#x2019;m honest, almost insurmountable. But Raleigh&#x2019;s stories invited me to walk right up to the hurting and look into their eyes&#x2014;not as a hero, but as a follower of Jesus.

Will their skills be enough to take down a brutal madman?</b><b><br></b>A brutal madman sprays bullets into a crowd of children leaving a San Francisco church. Miraculously-or was it intentionally?-only one person dies. Then an elderly black woman is hung. Police homicide inspector Lindsay Boxer senses a connection and together with medical examiner Claire, assistant D. A. Jill, and Chronicle reporter Cindy, finds a link that sends a chill through the entire nation. This killer's motives are unspeakable.<br>In this "inventive" installment of the Women's Murder Club, James Patterson proves once again why he is the #1 master of the murder mystery (<i>Sunday Times</i>).</p><p><i>2nd Chance</i> reconvenes the Women's Murder Club, four friends (a detective, a reporter, an assistant district attorney, and a medical examiner) who used their networking skills, feminine intuition, and professional wiles to solve a baffling series of murders in <i>1st to Die</i>. This time, the murders of two African Americans, a little girl and an old woman, bear all the signs of a serial killer for Lindsay Boxer, newly promoted to lieutenant of San Francisco's homicide squad. But there's an odd detail she finds even more disturbing: both victims were related to city cops. A symbol glimpsed at both murder scenes leads to a racist hate group, but the taunting killer strikes again and again, leaving deliberate clues and eluding the police ever more cleverly. In the meantime, each of the women has a personal stake at risk--and the killer knows who they are. <p> <i>2nd Chance</i> speeds along at a Formula One pace through many tight curves, but unlike recent entries in the Alex Cross series, it doesn't sacrifice good characters to a twisted plot. Lindsay's the star, but there's a fine <i>esprit de corps</i> among the four women, who are even better developed here than in the first book. What makes them both convincing and interesting as a criminal-justice juggernaut is their willingness to stick their necks out, even if they suffer for it.

A native Montanan and an applauded novelist (<em>In Open Spaces</em>, <em>High and Inside</em></i><em>), Rowland spent the better part of a year studying and traveling around his beloved home state, from the mines of Butte to the pine forests of the Northwest, from the stark, wind-scrubbed badlands of the East to the tourist-driven economies of the West. Along the way, he considered our state's essential character, where we came from, and, most of all, what we might be in the process of becoming."<i>Fifty-Six Counties: A Montana Journey</i> is astounding in beauty and vitality, interwoven with great wisdoms about human shadow and human light, touched by divine notions of the sacredness that binds all people, and graced with a hard won and ultimately natural sense of illumination."<br>&#x2015; <b>Shann Ray</b>, author of <i>American Copper, </i>winner of the Spur Award<br>"In a voice all his own, Rowland proves to be warm and personable, and yet cutting and real&#x2015;basically, one couldn't wish for a better guide to the state of Montana.

Most of us receive the immediate help we need friends attend funerals, relatives pour over photographs and reminisce, colleagues send emails expressing sympathy. But<br>consider the vacuum that happens later. I&#x2019;ve never met anyone who&#x2019;s stopped completely thinking about the person he or she loved, our memories flood in and out and wash over us at anticipated and unexpected times. Yet for the most part, a year after, five years later, 15 the outreach that once provided so much comfort is mostly gone. How odd is it that despite how connected we are today, finding meaningful ways to celebrate those who have passed away can be so hard to do?<br><br>The reason it&#x2019;s often frustrating is because there are so few guidelines to follow. A search on Amazon offers thousands of books on grieving, but hardly anything on concrete steps for remembering. And think about your local bookstore or library. Usually there are two or three shelves devoted to coping<br>with death, many offering helpful advice and specific guidance for moving on. But when it comes to identifying explicit ways to keep the memory of loved ones alive? I can&#x2019;t say I&#x2019;ve come across a satisfying option.<br><br>And there&#x2019;s another explanation why it&#x2019;s challenging. Mourning generally follows a precise choreography. Between the rituals of burial and the recitation of certain prayers, between the wakes and shiva calls the bereaved, and those who console them, know their role and take their place. To say it another way, when someone we love dies, we usually benefit from being the passive recipients of support. But when it comes to sustaining connections after loss, that work is up to us.<br><br>Not long ago hundreds of people attended the memorial services for my parents. Both times, in those first awful days and weeks that followed, I never had to look far to share a memory or hear one. Conversations were effortless. In some ways, looking back, mourning was made slightly easier because it seemed I&#x2019;d always have the opportunity to talk about my mom and dad. But a few years after they were gone, that cozy cocoon burst open.<br><br>While I no longer needed traditional grief support, I craved a new and different type of advice. How could I recognize their absence without making my family and friends uncomfortable? And what should I do with their belongings, not just the clothing and furniture, but all those pieces of paper the ticket stubs, the<br>birth certificates and marriage licenses, the emails and letters they wrote me? In some respects, because strategies like these are seldom discussed, I felt lonelier than when my parents died.<br><br>This is the experience of nearly every mourner not just those who&#x2019;ve lost a parent. Despite our social media circles, news feeds, and virtual support groups, ensuring those closest to us aren&#x2019;t forgotten is often an isolating task. And while it feels good to make a donation or run a race in their memory, we<br>have opportunities to do so much more. What&#x2019;s become pressing to me is finding and sharing tools for remembering that can be incorporated into anyone&#x2019;s life, whenever or however suddenly the mood strikes.<br></p><h2>Murder at the Mansion: A Victorian Village Mystery (Victorian Village Mysteries, 1)</h2><p><p><b>Welcome to Asheboro, Maryland, where the homes are to die for. . .</b> </p><p>Katherine Hamilton never wanted to return to her dead-end hometown.

Atherton is not what it seems, but something far more dangerous, with a history locked inside the mind of a madman and a future beyond Edgar's wildest imagining.</p><p>Patrick Carman's previous books in the Land of Elyon series (The Dark Hills Divide, Beyond the Valley of Thorns, and The Tenth City) have all been <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers. He is also the Creative Director of pcstudio, a packager and pioneer of the multimedia "vBook" (video+book), a format launched in 2009 with <em>Skeleton Creek</em>. He recently authored the fifth title in Rick Riordan's 39 Clues series, <em>The Black Circle.</em>Edgar lives in the desolate Tabletop, a place overshadowed by the mysterious Highlands. No one from Tabletop has ever been to the Highlands until Edgar successfully climbs up and finds a world opposite to his. He soon finds out the two worlds are, catastrophically, merging. Listening to this tale is a fully rounded experience. Carmans novel is engaging, and Jonathan Daviss narration is masterful. His cadence is a delight, and he moves gracefully from the stentorian tones of the rulers of the Highlands to the boyishness of Edgar to the resonant voice of the omniscient narrator. Dramatic points in the story are further enhanced by a sweeping musical score. Finally, bonus material includes illustrations from the book, studio photos, and more.

As their stories show, by focusing on the most positive and productive elements of any situation, you can shape your inner experience and expand your world. By learning to focus, you can improve your concentration, broaden your inner horizons, and most important, feel what it means to be fully alive.</p><p><br> <strong> Amazon Exclusive: Winifred Gallagher on <i>Rapt</i></strong> <br> <p> A wise research psychiatrist once told me that he had identified life's greatest problem: How to balance self and others, or your need for independence with your need for relationship? Since writing <i>Rapt</i>, I've come to believe that we now face a fundamental psychological challenge of a different sort: How to balance your need to know&#x2014;for the first time in history, fed by a bottomless spring of electronic information, from e-mail to Wikipedia--with your need to be? To think your thoughts, enjoy your companions, and do your work (to say nothing of staring into a fire or gazing dreamily at the sky) without interruption from beeps, vibrations, and flashing lights? Or perhaps worse, from the nagging sense that when you're off the grid, you're somehow missing out? <br><br> Science's new understanding of attention can help shape your answers to this question, which pops up all day long in various forms. When you sit at your computer, will you focus on writing that report or aimless web browsing? At the meeting, will you attend to the speaker or to your BlackBerry? Research suggests that your choices are more consequential than you may suspect. When you zero in on a sight or sound, thought or feeling, your brain spotlights and depicts that "target," which then becomes part of the subjective mental construct that you nonetheless confidently call "reality" or "the world." In contrast, things that you ignore don't, at least with anything like the same clarity. As William James succinctly puts it, "My experience is what I agree to attend to." <br><br> The realization that your life&#x2014;indeed, yourself--largely consists of the physical objects and mental subjects that you've focused on, from e-bay bargains to world peace, becomes even more sobering when you consider that, as the expression "pay attention" suggests, like your money, your concentration is a finite resource. How can you get the highest experiential return for this cognitive capital? By focusing on some screen or on playing your guitar? On IM-ing your old friend or joining her for a walk? <br><br> Considering the Internet's countless temptations and distractions, deciding how best to invest your time and attention when you're online is particularly challenging. Left to its own devices, your involuntary, "bottom-up" attention system asks, "What's the most obvious, compelling thing to zero in on here? That e-mail prompt? This colorful ad?" Fortunately, evolution has also equipped you with a voluntary, "top-down" attention system that poses a different question: "What do you want to focus on right now? Ordering that new novel, then checking the weather report, then getting back to work, right?" Sometimes, it's fun to just wander around online, allowing your mind to be captured by random, bottom-up distractions. In general, however, it's far more productive to focus on top-down targets you've selected to create the kind of experience you want to invite. <br><br> Along with making clear choices about what things merit your precious attention online, there are some other simple ways to protect the quality of your daily life from technological interference. Remember that your electronics are your servants, not your masters, and don't let them choose your focus for you. Abandon vain attempts to "multitask," because when you try to attend to two things at once&#x2014;phoning while checking e-mail&#x2014;you're simply switching rapidly between them, which takes longer and generates more errors. When you need to concentrate on an important activity, try to work for 90 minutes without interruptions, because rebooting your brain can take up to 20 minutes. <br><br> Most important, as you go about the day, bear in mind that by taking charge of your attention, you improve your experience, increase your concentration, and lift your spirits. Best of all, enjoying the rapt state of being completely absorbed, whether by a website or a sunset, a project or a person, simply makes life worth living. We cannot always be happy, but we can almost always be focused, which is as close as we can get. <br><br></p>Winifred Gallagher&#x2019;s books include <i>House Thinking, Just the Way You Are</i> (a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book), <i>Working on God</i>, and <i>The Power of Place</i>.

She touched her forehead and found it warm and glazed with sweat. Sinking down on the soft blue rug in front of the toilet, she was grateful for the momentary stability of the floor. But her head continued to spin, and her stomach churned. She lifted the toilet lid, gazed into the water, and wished she could disappear into its depths. Her breath became more shallow, and her nausea more intense. Finally, uncontrollably, and forcefully, all her distress erupted and she lost her lunch in heaves and waves of vomiting. Pepperoni pizza.<br> <br>She flushed the toilet several times as she sat on the floor waiting to feel normal again. Finally she stood up shakily, gargled with peppermint mouthwash, and peered at herself in the mirror.<br> <br>&#x201c;You look like a hot mess,&#x201d; she whispered to her reflection. Her skin, instead of its usual coppery brown, looked gray and mottled. She hadn&#x2019;t combed her hair all day, so it was a halo of tangles.<br> <br>November knew her mother would be home soon and would be angry to find out she&#x2019;d skipped school. She didn&#x2019;t care. Her thoughts were focused on the package in her backpack. Even though she knew the house was empty, she made sure the bathroom door was locked. She dug the little purple and pink box out of her book bag and placed it on the sink. It seemed out of place in her mother&#x2019;s perfectly coordinated powder blue bathroom.<br> <br>With trembling hands she unwrapped the plastic and opened the box. She read the directions carefully. She looked out of the small bathroom window and watched the last of the early spring snow melting on the grass. Everything looked the same, but she knew in her heart that it was all different now.<br> <br>November finally turned back to the little white tube in the box and followed the instructions, which were written, she noticed, in Spanish and French as well. Three minutes later the indicator silently screamed the news that she already suspected. She was pregnant.</p><h2>Does God Desire All to Be Saved?</h2><p><p><strong>Are There Two Wills in God?<br></strong>Divine Election and God&#x2019;s Desire for All to Be Saved&nbsp;</p><p>In this short, theological essay, John Piper builds a scriptural case that God&#x2019;s unconditional election unto salvation is compatible with God&#x2019;s genuine desire and offer for all to be saved.

Although the story takes place against the backdrop of war, it is not political, but a simple story about one day in the life of a young girl. After waking before dawn, Habiba and her sister go out to fetch water. Following a breakfast of khojur, she tags along with her brother and father as they bring the sheep to pasture. She goes to school outside with other girls; the boys attend school later in the day. Her family is preparing for cousins and an aunt and uncle to move in with them and Habiba wonders how everyone will fit into their small home. A country overview and glossary is included for parents and teachers who want to go beyond the story and talk more about Afghanistan and why it is important. In English and Afghan Farsi. For ages 5 and up.</p><p><p>Author, Dedie King, a Peace Corps volunteer in Nepal, also taught school there. She travels extensively and spends a considerable amount of time, not as a tourist, but immersed in many cultures, living with families who open their homes to her. She holds a MEd and has taught elementary school and children with learning disabilities. Her interest in writing books about different cultures is to bring awareness to young children of both the sameness and the differences of cultures around the world.</p><p>Judith Inglese has been designing and fabricating ceramic tile murals for public environments for more than thirty years. Her commissions include libraries, schools, hospitals and municipal and institutional buildings like the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. Her murals often focus on the play and imagination of children as well as cross-cultural exchange and community. In the <i>I See the Sun</i> books, she combines photography, cut paper and drawing in her collage illustrations. Like her ceramic tile murals, her illustrations are colorful and detailed with strong forms and line work.</p>Written in English and Dari (the official language of Afghanistan), this third book in the I See the Sun series provides a window into the life of an Afghan girl while touching on the effects of war. Habiba awakens before dawn to gather water from the well, attends school, and spends time with her family; but in the afternoon, Habiba's uncle (who has lost his legs), aunt, and cousins arrive--to stay.<br><br>K-Gr 2 -- This simple story follows a young Afghani girl from sunrise to sunset. Living in Bamiyan, a relatively safe city, Habiba fetches water, attends school, and anticipates the arrival of her cousins, who have lost their home because of the war. The story captures the flavor of the culture, and the love and support of this close family is evident. The story is written in both English and Dari (Afghan Farsi), and an author's note provides supplemental information. Inglese's watercolor and collage illustrations are well composed, and color and pattern add richness and texture. This interesting glimpse into the day-to-day life in this turbulent country will allow children to appreciate the similarities and differences that exist between the two cultures.- Grace Oliff, Ann Blanche Smith School, Hillsdale, NJSchool Library Journal</p><h2>Shrink Rap (Sunny Randall)</h2><p><b>Boston P.I.

Without a doubt, says Justo Gonzalez, it&#x2019;s Luke. Concerned about the particulars of people and events, Luke also gives readers the big picture, positioning the stories of Jesus not just in the history of Israel but in the history of humankind. Luke uniquely tells us the grand story of salvation -- then and now.<br><br>Gonzalez skillfully highlights key themes in Luke&#x2019;s storytelling, including his strong emphasis on God&#x2019;s &#x201c;great reversals,&#x201d; his keen interest in shared meals and their intimate connection to worship and communion, and his passionate underscoring of both the saving work of Christ and the indwelling power of the Holy Spirit. Writing in a conversational style, Gonzalez draws readers into Luke&#x2019;s story with fresh overviews and rich details, showing how Luke invites us to continue his gospel witness today.<br><br>Watch a 2014 interview with the author of this book here:<br><br></p><p>Justo L.

Never again will I read Luke without drawing on Gonz�lez's insights, which now seem indispensable."<br><br><b>Paul Borgman</b><br> &#x2014; author of&nbsp;<i>The Way according to Luke</i><br> "A crisply written primer on major themes and cultural contexts in Luke-Acts.

In contrast, Adam Smith, now hailed as the founding father of capitalism, was a revered professor of moral philosophy. Remarkably, Hume and Smith were best friends, sharing what Dennis Rasmussen calls the greatest of all philosophical friendships. <i>The Infidel and the Professor</i> tells the fascinating story of the close relationship between these towering Enlightenment thinkers&#x2015;and how it influenced their world-changing ideas. It shows that Hume contributed more to economics&#x2015;and Smith contributed more to philosophy&#x2015;than is generally recognized. The result is a compelling account of a great friendship that had great consequences for modern thought.</p></p><p><p>"<i>The Infidel and the Professor</i> is the first book on the fascinating subject of the friendship between David Hume and Adam Smith.

Levitical rules and regulations can at first appear irrelevant to contemporary Christians--but they provide important Old Testament background for understanding large portions of the New Testament. Leviticus describes a point in human history when God came and dwelt in the midst of the ancient Israelites and taught them what their purpose in life really was. Jay Sklar's commentary makes clear what it is that the Lord said to them and, in so doing, makes clear what he says to us today.</p><p>Generally speaking, a commentary aims to give the reader an understanding of what a particular verse or passage is trying to say. With this commentary, I have had three further goals in mind.<br> &nbsp;<br> First,<i>&nbsp;I have tried to be aware of issues in the text that will seem strange, or simply wrong, to modern people.</i>&nbsp;As you are aware, Leviticus has many of these! As much as possible, I try to provide the reader with help in terms of how to address these concerns. Here are just a few of the questions we often have in reading Leviticus (and the pages where the questions are addressed): How do we know which laws apply today? And why do Christians say some laws don't apply (like food laws) and others do (like laws on sexual ethics) (pp. 57-62, 237-238)? Why are so many of the penalties so severe (pp. 62-69)? A woman is ritually impure for twice as long after the birth of a female than after the birth of a male; is this a sign of sexism (pp. 177-179)? Are the laws about ritual impurity and menstruation oppressive to women (p. 203)? Does Leviticus condone slavery (pp. 307-301)? In many cases, if these questions are not addressed when teaching or preaching on these passages, our listeners will be unable to hear the rest of what the passage is trying to say.<br> &nbsp;<br> Second, where possible,<i>&nbsp;I have tried to use language throughout the commentary that translates well to the person in the pew.</i>&nbsp;It is easy to describe things in a technical way, but it is far more helpful to the teacher or preacher to describe things using everyday language and examples where possible. For example, in Lev 8 we read about some Israelites becoming priests. Part of the ceremony involves a changing of garments. Now it's possible simply to say, "The people becoming priests change their garments as a way of indicating that they are entering into a new role in society, something that anthropologists might call a rite of passage." That's all well and good, but it seems to me more helpful to the teacher or preacher if the commentary says, "In most societies, we use special clothing to indicate that we have entered into a special state or have a special role. A bride's wedding dress sets her apart as the one who is getting married. A soldier's uniform sets him apart as part of the military. That is what is happening in this chapter: the priests change into special priestly clothes as a way of indicating that they now have a special role." That is what this commentary aims to do.<br> &nbsp;<br> Finally, t<i>he brief application section always begins with the question of how this would have applied to an ancient Israelite before discussing how it&nbsp;applies to the follower of Jesus today.</i>&nbsp;This is crucial. The Lord gave Leviticus to specific people (the Israelites) in a specific time and place (at Mt. Sinai just after their departure from Egypt). To understand the text properly, interpretation has to begin with this original audience. Otherwise, we are not reading the text in its context and this will almost always lead to errors in understanding. (Many of us have had a personal experience of this when people take our own words out of context!) But once we begin with the original context, we not only find it easier to understand what the Lord was saying then, we also find it easier to see how his words apply to us today. To take just one example, the more that I understood what sacrificial atonement meant in the context of ancient Israel, the more beautiful and moving the sacrificial death of Jesus became -- so much so that it is often hard for me to sings songs that mention sacrifice or atonement without tears coming to my eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Many blessings to you in your service of Jesus, "the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!" (John 1:29).Jay Sklar (PhD, the University of Gloucestershire), is Professor of Old Testament and Dean of Faculty at Covenant Theological Seminary in St. Louis. His doctoral research was completed under Professor Gordon Wenham and focused on the theology of sacrifice (<i>Sin, Impurity, Sacrifice, Atonement: the Priestly Conceptions</i>).

With the help of a bumbling wizard and his crew, they must scour the many worlds of the Pirate Stream to gather the pieces of the Map to Everywhere--but they aren't the only ones looking. A sinister figure is hot on their tail, and if they can't beat his ghostly ship to find the Map, it could mean the destruction of everything they hold dear!<br><br>Heart-pounding escapades and a colorful cast of characters will have readers setting sail through this wholly original and unforgettable tale.<br></p><p>Carrie Ryan and John Parke Davis have been in love with each other's writing (and with each other) since meeting in law school. Carrie is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Forest of Hands and Teeth series. JP is the First Assistant Federal Defender for the Western District of North Carolina.Gr 4&#x2013;6&#x2014;Fin is so forgettable, no one can remember him for more than a few minutes. Left by his mother at an orphanage in the pirate city of Khaznot Quay at the age of four, he's been on his own ever since. Fin uses his curse to his benefit by becoming a master thief. When he receives a letter directing him to steal a key in exchange for treasures and a promise to show him the way home, he accidentally releases the Oracle, an insane wizard who had been carefully guarded for centuries. Meanwhile in another world, adventurous Marrill, stuck in suburban Arizona, finds an enormous ship in a parking lot. Soon she's traveling the pirate stream, a waterway connecting all worlds, joined by a wizard on a quest for the Map to Everywhere, which they will need to get Marrill home. Fin and Marrill's paths intersect and they set about stealing and reassembling the map&#x2014;each piece located in a different world. The task becomes further complicated when they realize the Oracle is also after the map. Alternating between Fin and Marilll's points of view, a slower beginning allows for compelling character development in the first quarter the book. When the plots merge, the pacing picks up, mirroring the urgency of the characters, though readers may wish for more time to digest and appreciate the various worlds before racing on to the next. Husband and wife team Ryan and Davis have created wholly original settings, and the juxtaposition of Fin and Marrill's backgrounds and personalities is enjoyable and humorous. This is an ambitious undertaking, and strong readers who enjoy adventure fiction and fantasy will inhale the first book in what has the potential to be an extraordinary series.&#x2014;Juliet Morefield, Multnomah County Library, OR</p><h2>Be My Neighbor (Global Fund for Children Books)</h2><p>Readers will celebrate diversity as they travel around the world to learn what it means to be a good neighbor in communities across the globe.

Sometimes they live in the same real neighborhood. But they can also be 'neighbors' even if they live far away." Illustrated with bright, beautiful full-color photos of children around the world, the gorgeous spreads are organized by themes, including homes, schools, places of worship, recreational areas, transportation, celebrations, and sharing responsibilities to improve your neighborhood and the lives of those who live there. With photos depicting everything from an open-air Mexican market to a Guatemalan village to a Hanukkah celebration in the U.S., this book celebrates diversity, all the while emphasizing our overarching similarities.

Harry Haft was a sixteen-year-old Polish Jew when he entered a concentration camp in 1944. Forced to fight other Jews in bare-knuckle bouts for the perverse entertainment of SS officers, Harry quickly learned that his own survival depended on his ability to fight and win. Haft details the inhumanity of the "sport" in which he must perform in brutal contests for the officers. Ultimately escaping the camp, Haft&#x2019;s experience left him an embittered and pugnacious young man. <br><br>Determined to find freedom, Haft traveled to America and began a career as a professional boxer, quickly finding success using his sharp instincts and fierce confidence. In a historic battle, Haft fights in a match with Rocky Marciano, the future undefeated heavyweight champion of the world. Haft&#x2019;s boxing career takes him into the world of such boxing legends as Rocky Graziano, Roland La Starza, and Artie Levine, and he reveals new details about the rampant corruption at all levels of the sport. <br><br>In sharp contrast to Elie Wiesel&#x2019;s scholarly, pious protagonist in Night, Harry Haft is an embattled survivor, challenging the reader&#x2019;s capacity to understand suffering and find compassion for an antihero whose will to survive threatens his own humanity. Haft&#x2019;s account, at once dispassionate and deeply absorbing, is an extraordinary story and an invaluable contribution to Holocaust literature.</p><p>A fascinating story of Holocaust survival at all costs.Alan Scott Haft is the eldest son of Harry Haft. He graduated from Queens College and received his J.D. from the University of Miami Law School.</p><h2>The Premarital Counseling Handbook</h2><p>In any endeavor, dreams and goals not backed by concrete plans and preparations can result in failure. And marriage is no exception, claims H. Norman Wright. In fact, without solid planning and forethought by engaged couples, we will surely see a continuation of the startling divorce rate among Christians and non-Christians alike. On the other hand, thorough premarital counseling and preparation can result in lifelong marriages that are fulfilling and God honoring. That's where the church comes in. <br><br>More and more churches are realizing that their responsibility lies not only in pronouncing men and women 'husband and wife,' but also in making sure the proper foundation is laid so that marriages have a better chance of standing strong under pressure. Since its introduction in 1977 as <i>Premarital Counseling</i>, this book has been used by thousands of churches throughout the country as both a guide and reference tool. Now Dr. Wright has added new material to cover some perplexing issues that have come into prominence only recently. Among those special concerns are interracial marriages, second marriages, and marriages of persons from dysfunctional families. <br><br>Writing for both pastors and other premarital counselors, H. Norman Wright sets you at ease about the counseling process, even if you've had only limited counseling experience. As the author of the popular <i>Before You Say I Do</i> and numerous other books on marriage, H. Norman Wright documents in The <i>Premarital Counseling Handbook</i> methods hat have proved successful. These will help insure that the marriages performed in your church will resist the pressures that are destroying today's married couples.</p><p>Since its introduction in 1977 as Premarital Counseling, this book has been used by literally thousands of churches throughout the country as both a guide and reference tool.

Abbey Road introduced a number of new techniques and technologies to the Beatles' sound, and included "Come Together," "Something," and "Here Comes the Sun," which all emerged as classics. </p><p>Womack's colorful retelling of how this landmark album was written and recorded is a treat for fans of the Beatles. <i>Solid State</i> takes readers back to 1969 and into EMI's Abbey Road Studio, which boasted an advanced solid state transistor mixing desk. Womack focuses on the dynamics between John, Paul, George, Ringo, and producer George Martin and his team of engineers, who set aside (for the most part) the tensions and conflicts that had arisen on previous albums to create a work with an innovative (and, among some fans and critics, controversial) studio-bound sound that prominently included the new Moog synthesizer, among other novelties. </p><p>As Womack shows, <i>Abbey Road </i>was the culmination of the instrumental skills, recording equipment, and artistic vision that the band and George Martin had developed since their early days in the same studio seven years earlier. A testament to the group's creativity and their producer's ingenuity, <i>Solid</i> <i>State </i>is required reading for all fans of the Beatles and the history of rock 'n' roll<i>.</i></p></p><p><p>Kenneth Womack's previous books about the Beatles include <i>Long and Winding Roads </i>and <i>The Beatles Encyclopedia.</i> He is also the author of the acclaimed two-volume biography of Sir George Martin,<i> Maximum Volume</i> and <i>Sound Pictures.</i> Womack is Dean of Humanities and Social Sciences at Monmouth University, where he also serves as Professor of English.

The subject index covers African American, Native American, and women's history; maps out key places in such areas as European exploration and settlement, industry and agriculture, and transportation and communication; and canvasses the American Revolution, the War of 1812, the Civil War, and such notable sites as courthouses, houses of worship, educational institutions, forts, and famous homes and homesites. Vacationers and those simply out for a drive will stumble across sites as diverse as Jamestown and the birthplace of Booker T. Washington, the graves of country music's Carter family and the original locations of northern Virginia's Nike missile installations, the places where paramount chief Powhatan first met with the English and where the artist Georgia O'Keeffe taught art, and Langley Field, which played a significant role in the history of manned space flight.Virginia has one of the oldest marker systems in the country, established in 1927. The markers are no longer state funded, and so the program illustrates a collaborative effort between committed sponsors who offer financial support, the Virginia Department of Historic Resources, and the Virginia Department of Transportation. The network holds great appeal for tourists and serves as a source of pride for local citizens.Travelers along Virginia's highways will find this guide both useful and informative. The great legacy of Virginia's past is revealed on these markers, making the book both a handy reference and a stimulus to greater study of the history of the commonwealth.</p></p><p><p>Scott David Arnold is Manager of the Historical Highway Marker Program at the Virginia Department of Historic Resources.</p></p><h2>I Married You</h2><p>Set in a big city in Africa, covering only a few days of Walter and Ingrid�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s life, the story develops in a surprising and suspenseful way.

All the stories have really happened. All of the conversations have really taken place. The people involved are still living today.

Christ's resurrection power is available to meet your need and draw you closer to Him, asserts Dr. Tony Evans. If your heart longs to know Him and serve Him, you can experience a deeper relationship with Him. </p><p>Satan loves to coil himself around the minds of Christians, keeping us spiritually off balance and defeated by confusing our identity. But Satan has no authority over us. Christ can live His life through us. </p><p>Are you tired of your attempts at self-sufficiency? Are you tired of being in bondage to your sin?

For more information, visit: http://www.TonyEvans.org.The story is told that the queen of England was trying to get her daughter to sit still. She started the way most parents start. "Young lady, be still." That worked for a while, but the girl started wiggling again. Then it was, "I said, be still!" But nothing worked to keep the girl quiet until the queen said, "Young lady, be still. Don't you know who you are?" In other words, "You're a princess. Act like it." The girl got the message this time, because the queen tied her daughter's behavior to her identity. We can tell each other all day to stop doing this or that. But if we don't see the connection between our identity in Christ and our actions, I'm going to start wiggling after a while, and so will you. If you have a heart that desperately desires to know and serve God, the place to begin is by understanding and believing the biblical truth of your identity in Christ. This is a watershed issue, one that determines whether you will live free in Christ or live as a slave of the world, the flesh, and the devil.<br></p><h2>Verbal Behavior Analysis: Inducing and Expanding New Verbal Capabilities in Children with Language Delays</h2><p><p> <b>Help children develop language and verbal functions!</b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;This is definitely a book I will be purchasing for my professional use.

Lessa is an outcast survivor&#x2014;her parents murdered, her birthright stolen&#x2014;a strong young woman who has never stopped dreaming of revenge. But when an ancient threat to Pern reemerges, Lessa will rise&#x2014;upon the back of a great dragon with whom she shares a telepathic bond more intimate than any human connection. Together, dragon and rider will fly . . . and Pern will be changed forever.</p><p>There are dragons all over Anne McCaffrey's house. Some she's bought, but many have been made for her by adoring fans and given to her as gifts. I don't make dragons, of course. But whenever circumstances allow, I do try to bring her American bacon, something she can't get easily in Ireland, and something which she has taught all her friends there to love, as well! I remember the first time I went to visit her, when she was still living in her old, much smaller but very homey, house. My husband and I arrived at the doorstep, and she immediately began bustling about, frying up some of the bacon we'd brought and sharing a lovely late breakfast with us before sending us off to the hotel for a nap. She made us dinner that night, too--the one and only time in my life that I've actually liked shrimp cocktail. Maybe that's because if you squint your eyes and look sideways, shrimp are kind of dragonlike, and I was eating them in the right company!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Shelly Shapiro, Executive EditorHOW CAN ONE GIRL SAVE AN ENTIRE WORLD? <br>To the nobles who live in Benden Weyr, Lessa is nothing but a ragged kitchen girl. For most of her life she has survived by serving those who betrayed her father and took over his lands. Now the time has come for Lessa to shed her disguise--and take back her stolen birthright. <br>But everything changes when she meets a queen dragon. The bond they share will be deep and last forever. It will protect them when, for the first time in centuries, Lessa's world is threatened by Thread, an evil substance that falls like rain and destroys everything it touches. Dragons and their Riders once protected the planet from Thread, but there are very few of them left these days. Now brave Lessa must risk her life, and the life of her beloved dragon, to save her beautiful world. . . .</p><h2>Sue Kwon: Street Level: New York Photographs 1987-2007</h2><p><i>Street Level</i> collects 20 years of documentary and commercial photography by esteemed New York photographer Sue Kwon. Her subjects include some of Hip Hop's finest, such as the Beastie Boys, Biggie Smalls and the Wu-Tang Clan, as well as portraits and street scenes from New York's most charismatic neighborhoods--Little Italy, Chinatown, Coney Island, the Lower East Side and a pre-Guiliani Times Square. These black-and-white images, characterized by an evident fondness for the lives they depict, are populated with recruits from all realms and occasions, from shoe-shiners to inmates at the Rahway State Prison to newlyweds and strippers between sets at the infamous Sue's Rendezvous. As direct and candid as their subjects, Sue Kwon's photographs share a kinship with those of the legendary New York documentary photographer Helen Levitt. Although Kwon is well known in the Hip Hop world, this is the first complete monograph to survey her work.<br><br><b>Sue Kwon</b> began her career at the <i>Village Voice</i>, shooting subjects that ranged from N.W.A. to Covenant House runaways to underground Jamaican nightclubs in Queens.

They ride on a busy highway full of cars and signs, past charming villages and topiary-filled parks, out into the country. But when they finally arrive at the picnic spot, they discover all their food has tumbled out of the car along the way! It's up to readers to find the missing food so the family can enjoy their meal at last.</p><p>B. B.

This installment follows Grandad and the children as they make their way through a park, towns, and villages, across a river, and by a gas station on their way to a picnic, all while dreaming of the many treats they will enjoy when they get there. Each page offers something new to discover, including many of their picnic basket items that have been left along the way. The bright, saturated illustrations and enchanting spreads completely suck readers in. Cronin's recognizable style is reminiscent of that of classic picture books but has a modern feel and a vibrant neon palette. Like any good seek-and-find book, this one ends with a callout to readers: "Can you go back to the start of their journey and find all the items, so Grandad and the kids can have their picnic?" VERDICT Highly recommended for fans of The Lost House and anyone who loves to seek and find. A wonderful addition to any library, and an irresistible escape for both young and old.&#x2014;Elizabeth Blake, Brooklyn Public Library</p><h2>Real Relationships Workbook: From Bad to Better and Good to Great</h2><p><p><strong>Digging below the surface to take you to a whole new level. </strong></p><p>Offering expert advice and practical tools for improving the most important aspect of human life, this workbook is integral to getting the most out of <em>Real Relationships</em>--Drs.

Dorael-Ri had tracked them all the way from the settlement of Merel, at the border of Davokar. A small, human child one of few to survive the massacre had asked how he dared to travel the woods alone. In Davokar you are never alone, he had answered. Not me, nor you, no one Aided by mystical rituals Dorael had managed to follow the cold tracks, but now the enemy was close enough for his friend and servant, the owl Strigi, to take over the hunt. He raised his black sword, took a deep breath and placed the Horn Mask over his face; vengeful spirits immediately flocked around him, veiling him from the world. The sword quivered in his hand, hungering for tainted flesh and blood. Soon my dear, soon, he whispered. For this enemy, simpler steel will do. He put the hallowed sword back in its scabbard and drew the shorter blade that had belonged to his sister. Soon he lunged through the forest, with Strigi soaring at his side. The first enemy fell before any of the cultists realized that the avenger had come.

This anthology comes at a time when gender identity politics and profits from an emerging medical transgenderism industry for children, teens, and adults inhibit our ability to have meaningful discussions about sex, gender, changing laws that have provided sex-based protections for women and girls, and the re-framing of language referring to females as a distinct biological class. Standing strongly against gender stereotypes, female oppression, and the sexual violence prevalent in all levels of society, women&#x2019;s voices celebrate their lives and examine their struggles through articles, essays, firsthand accounts, and verse. Lesbian feminists, political feminists, spiritual feminists, heterosexual-womanist women, mothers, scholars, attorneys, poets, medical and mental health professionals, educators, environmentalists, and detransitioning women all boldly vocalize their unique perspectives and universal experiences. The contributors to Female Erasure know that their views are controversial, and many people will oppose their work. But they refuse to be silenced by critics, striving instead toward deep, meaningful discussion with readers about the biases of modern society and the future of women&#x2019;s rights.</p><p>Ruth Barrett, anthology editor and contributor, has dedicated her life to stopping gender oppression and providing safe, sacred, female-sovereign spaces for women and girls.

Preaching has been resourced and taught from a narrow field of cultural or gendered experiences, historically. Without much support from established channels, black women are left to &#x201c;figure it out&#x201d; on their own, and others discern how to preach from a limiting scope.<br> <br> The best preachers understand their own voices and the voices of others. They stretch and grow, and this enables them to preach more effectively.

Did Richard III really kill &#x201c;the Princes in the Tower,&#x201d; as is commonly believed, or was the murderer someone else entirely? Carefully examining every shred of contemporary evidence as well as dozens of modern accounts, Alison Weir reconstructs the entire chain of events leading to the double murder. We are witnesses to the rivalry, ambition, intrigue, and struggle for power that culminated in the imprisonment of the princes and the hushed-up murders that secured Richard&#x2019;s claim to the throne as Richard III. A masterpiece of historical research and a riveting story of conspiracy and deception, <i>The Princes in the Tower</i> at last provides a solution to this age-old puzzle.<br></p></p><p>Alison Weir goes to contemporary sources to unravel the fate of the sons of Edward lV, the princes in the Tower of London. These sources include the account of Dominic Mancini, an Italian monk who was in England from 1482-July 1483 as part of a French delegation and the Croyland Chronicles. Other writers, including novelists Josephine Tey and Sharon Kay Penmann, have examined the disappearance of Edward V and his younger brother.

Did Richard III really kill "the Princes in the Tower," as is commonly believed, or was the murderer someone else entirely?<p>In this utterly absorbing and meticulously researched book, English writer Alison Weir, an authority on the history of the British royal family, at last provides a conclusive solution to this age-old puzzle. Carefully examining every shred of contemporary evidence as well as the dozens of modern accounts, Weir reconstructs the entire chain of events leading to the double murder.</p><p>In The Princes in the Tower we are witnesses to the tumultuous reign of Edward IV, the princes' powerful, handsome, promiscuous father. We see the unfolding rivalry between the Wydvilles, the common family of Edward's shrewd queen, and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, his ambitious brother. Finally we are swept up in the vortex of intrigue that followed Edward's death - the naming of his twelve-year-old son Edward as heir; Richard's swift arrival in London and his lightning strike for power; the imprisonment of the princes in the Tower of London; and the hushed-up murders that secured Richard's claim to the throne as Richard III.</p><p>Weir considers in turn each of the prime suspects in the murder: the grasping, conspiratorial Duke of Buckingham; the shadowy Sir James Tyrell, Richard's trusted retainer; the possibility that the boys may have died of natural causes; and of course, Richard III himself, a complex man of charm and intelligence twisted by a ruthless ambition for power.</p><p>More than an historical murder mystery, The Princes in the Tower is a richly detailed tapestry of English court life in the late fifteenth century - the bitter rivalries that exploded in the Wars of the Roses; the splendor and corruption of the royal family; the violence and treachery that coexisted with exquisite beauty and refinement. At the very center of that tapestry is the tragic image of two pale, innocent, bewildered boys, an image that has haunted our minds for half a millennium. Powerfully written, persuasively argued, and totally mesmerizing to read, The Princes in the Tower is at once a masterpiece of historical research and a riveting story of conspiracy, murder, and deception.</p></p><h2>When a Dragon Moves In Again</h2><p>If you build a perfect castle, a dragon will move in &#x2013; and that&#x2019;s exactly what happens to one very lucky boy when his family gears up for some changes.

Yet today, the primordial forests of the Madre de Dios are in danger from developers, oil giants, and gold miners eager to exploit its natural resources.</p><p>In <em>Mother of God</em>, this explorer and conservationist relives his amazing odyssey exploring the heart of this wildest place on earth.

In the Madre de Dios ("Mother of God") region of Peru, where the Amazon River begins, the cloud forests of the Andes converge with the lowland Amazon rain forest to create the most biodiverse wilderness on the planet.</p><p>In a true story of adventure and discovery that spans more than nine years, Rosolie takes us into the most inaccessible reaches of the Amazon. Along the way, he encounters massive snakes, isolated tribes, prowling jaguars, giant anteaters, and much more in the Wild West of the natural world. It is a journey into the last great wilderness that ultimately asks the question of our time: How much longer will these places exist? The primordial depths of the Madre de Dios are in grave danger.</p><p><em>Mother of God</em> is the story of an amazing odyssey into the heart of the wildest place on earth.

And a few weeks later, she was installed as Duke Phelan's newest recruit in a company of soldiers for hire, her arms training about to begin. But when Paks sees combat, she's stabbed with an ensorcelled knife and barely survives. Then the near-misses start mounting up, raising questions about this young fighter. Is she attracting evil because she is a danger to them all? Or is there another reason malignant forces seek her life?</p><p>Paks will face the spider-minions of the Webmistress Achrya, orcs and the corrupted men who serve blood mage Liart, Master of Torments. She will also earn the gratitude of elves and of her Duke. And through conflict she will learn she has powers of her own and a destiny. To become a gods-chosen Paladin of Gird, and a target for the ultimate torture.</p></p><p>Never in our experience has a new author burst upon the sf/fantasy field to such immediate enthusiastic recognition as Elizabeth Moon with her fantasy trilogy, Sheepfarmer&#39;s Daughter, Divided Allegiance, and Oath of Gold.

A Tactical Manual for Post Collapse Survival</h2><p>REVISED &amp; EXPANDED SECOND EDITION This manual is the result of a detailed consideration of a societal collapse and the civil shift and aftermath that would impact individuals and families who are intent on survival. The purpose of this manual is to provide information to enhance the security, tactics, and survival skills of law-abiding citizens who are faced with civil disorder, lawlessness, violence, and physical threat in a post-collapse environment. The information in this manual is derived from training and experience gained from service with special operations forces (SOF) and subsequent employment as a security contractor in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is a distillation of tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) adapted to the threat and environment anticipated in this type of scenario, in order to provide the knowledge needed to survive in a world turned upside down. It is no longer just survival of the fittest but survival of those prepared. The manual will take you from self-defense as an individual, team and family, and on to tactics, techniques, procedures and training that can be used by tactical teams that you may need to form in order to survive or to resist tyranny. In a serious post-event scenario, one of total collapse with several months or years before recovery, families, groups and communities may be forced to create such tactical defense forces to protect personnel, loved ones and resources against hostile forces. There is something in this manual for both the tactical newbie and the military veteran.

Israel, occupying a narrow strip of land between sea and desert, was positioned on an international highway of commerce and warfare. This was a people whose future would be intertwined with the stories of nations great and small. F. F. Bruce shapes the daunting complexities of this history, nearly fourteen hundred years from the exodus to the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, into straight prose that sparkles with clarity. More than half of the book is devoted to the postexilic history of Israel, the "intertestamental" period and the first-century history that forms the backdrop of the New Testament. First published in 1963, <em>Israel and the Nations</em> has achieved wide recognition as an excellent introduction to the history of Israel. This new edition, carefully revised by David F.

On this day, the price of corn&#x2014;the main ingredient in tortillas&#x2014;would hit an all-time high of 35 cents a pound, a price that would have been unfathomable just a year before. Corn was suddenly 400 percent more expensive than it had been just three months earlier. With half of all Mexicans living below the poverty line, a sudden increase of this magnitude was not just a nuisance, it was a potential humanitarian and political crisis.<br> <br>As the sun lifted higher in the sky, the voices of tens of thousands of citizens, farmers, and union activists could be heard gathering in one of the city&#x2019;s central squares. Above their heads, they raised not weapons, but ears of corn. The tortilla riots, as they came to be called, echoed throughout the day, taking over one of the main downtown streets and challenging the new government of President Felipe Calder�n. Well into the evening, protestors chanted, &#x201c;Tortillas s�, pan no!&#x201d;&#x2014;a pun on Calder�n&#x2019;s National Action Party, the PAN, which also means &#x201c;bread&#x201d; in Spanish&#x2014;and barked out their suspicions about just who was behind the rise in prices: the government, big business, and the wealthy elite of the country. Union leaders and television celebrities railed against corporations for price fixing and chastised the beef and pig ranchers for hoarding their grains.<br> <br>While the ranchers and political leaders were natural objects of class indignation, they were not, this time at least, the principal culprits. Indeed, the protestors could scarcely have guessed the truth: The slowly burning fuse that had ignited the explosion in corn prices had been lit several years before and a thousand miles away by a seemingly disconnected event&#x2014;Hurricane Katrina.<br> <br>Here&#x2019;s how: In August 2005, the impending winds of the devastating hurricane had prompted the mass evacuation and shutdown of the 2,900 oil rigs that dot the Gulf Coast from Texas to Louisiana, disrupting almost 95 percent of oil production in the Gulf for several months. In the aftermath of the storm, the price of gasoline in America surged, in some places by as much as 40 cents per gallon in a single day. This spike in oil prices made corn&#x2014;the primary ingredient in the alternative fuel ethanol&#x2014;look relatively cheap by comparison and spurred investment in domestic ethanol production. U.S. farmers, among the most efficient and most heavily subsidized in the world, were encouraged to replace their edible corn crops with inedible varieties suitable for ethanol production. By 2007, even Congress had gotten in on the act, mandating a fivefold increase in biofuel production&#x2014;with more than 40 percent of it to come from corn.<br> <br>Amid the euphoria of this ethanol investment bubble, almost no one considered potential impacts on Mexico&#x2019;s peasant farmers, who, in the decade between the passage of NAFTA and the arrival of Katrina, had found themselves thrust into international competition with powerhouse U.S. agribusinesses north of their border. American corn growers routinely sold (many would argue dumped) their product on Mexican markets at almost 20 percent less than it cost to produce it. Unable to keep up&#x2014;even with the support of their own domestic subsidies&#x2014;many rural Mexican farmers had switched the variety of corn they grew, switched crops altogether, or abandoned their farms, swelling the ranks of Mexico City&#x2019;s underclass and further accelerating Mexico&#x2019;s position as a primary market for cheap U.S. varieties.<br> <br>As NAFTA took hold, this expanding corn import market had also become increasingly dominated by a tiny clique of powerful transnational corporations, mostly headquartered in the United States, including Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland, along with their Mexican subsidiaries. These companies accelerated the transition already at work by doing what dominant incumbents instinctively do: concentrating power, tightening their control over the market, and squeezing out smaller suppliers. The result: Mexico, famous as the place that domesticated the growing of corn ten thousand years ago, soon became a net food importer&#x2014;and the third largest of U.S. agricultural products&#x2014;much of it channeled through a tiny constellation of companies.<br> <br>It was against this backdrop that, in the year that followed Katrina, with increasing amounts of the United States&#x2019; domestic supply being diverted to ethanol, the price of corn became inextricably coupled to the price of oil&#x2014;not only because ethanol and oil are comparable fuels, but also because it takes an enormous amount of petroleum-derived fertilizers to grow corn in the first place. As the price of a barrel of petroleum fluctuated, the price of a bushel of corn began increasingly to move in lockstep. When global speculation drove the cost of a barrel of oil to nearly $140, the now-linked price of corn also skyrocketed, provoking what may become an archetypal experience of the twenty-first century: a food riot.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>We are, of course, used to these kinds of stories. Each week, it seems, brings some unforeseen disruption, blooming amid the thicket of overlapping social, political, economic, technological, and environmental systems that govern our lives. They arrive at a quickening yet erratic pace, usually from unexpected quarters, stubbornly resistant to prediction. The most severe become cultural touchstones, referred to in staccato shorthand: Katrina. Haiti. BP. Fukushima. The Crash. The Great Recession. The London mob. The Arab Spring. Other nameless disruptions swell their ranks, amplified by slowly creeping vulnerabilities: a midwestern town is undone by economic dislocation; a company is obliterated by globalization; a way of life is rendered impossible by an ecological shift; a debt crisis emerges from political intractability. If it feels like the pace of these disruptions is increasing, it&#x2019;s not just you: It took just six months for 2011 to become the costliest year on record for natural disasters, a fact that insurance companies tie unambiguously to climate change. Volatility of all sorts has become the new normal, and it&#x2019;s here to stay.<br> <br>While the details are always different, certain features of these disruptions are remarkably consistent, whether we&#x2019;re discussing the recent global financial crisis, the geopolitical outcomes of the war in Iraq, or the surprising consequences of a natural disaster. One hallmark of such events is that they reveal the dependencies between spheres that are more often studied and discussed in isolation from one another. The story of the tortilla riots, for example, makes visible the linkages between the energy system (the oil rigs) the ecological system (Katrina), the agricultural system (the corn harvest), the global trade system (NAFTA), social factors (urbanization and poverty), and the political systems of both Mexico and the United States.<br> <br>We tell such stories to encourage humility in the face of the incomprehensible complexity, interconnectivity, and volatility of the modern world&#x2014;one in which upheavals can appear to be triggered by seemingly harmless events, arrive with little warning, and reveal hidden, almost absurd correlations in their wake. Like pulling on an errant string in a garment, which unravels the whole even as it reveals how the elements were previously woven together, we make sense of these stories only in retrospect. Even with a deep understanding of the individual systems involved, we usually find it difficult to untangle the chain of causation at work. And for all of the contributions of the much-ballyhooed Information Age, just having more data doesn&#x2019;t automatically help. After all, if we could actually see each of the individual packets of data pulsing through the Internet, or the complex chemical interactions affecting our climate, could we make sense of them? Could we predict in detail over the long term where those systems are headed or what strange consequences might be unleashed along the way? Even with perfect knowledge, one can&#x2019;t escape the nagging suspicion we&#x2019;re ballroom dancing in the middle of a minefield.<br> <br>So what to do?<br> <br>If we cannot control the volatile tides of change, we can learn to build better boats. We can design&#x2014;and redesign&#x2014;organizations, institutions, and systems to better absorb disruption, operate under a wider variety of conditions, and shift more fluidly from one circumstance to the next. To do that, we need to understand the emerging field of resilience.<br> <br>Around the world, in disciplines as seemingly disconnected as economics, ecology, political science, cognitive science, and digital networking, scientists, policymakers, technologists, corporate leaders, and activists alike are asking the same basic questions: What causes one system to break and another to rebound? How much change can a system absorb and still retain its integrity and purpose? What characteristics make a system adaptive to change? In an age of constant disruption, how do we build in better shock absorbers for ourselves, our communities, companies, economies, societies, and the planet?<br> <br>Like a developing Polaroid, the insights, lessons, and rules of thumb they are discovering are revealing an entirely new field&#x2014;a set of generalizable insights for building social, economic, technical, and business systems that anticipate disruption, heal themselves when breached, and have the ability to reorganize themselves to maintain their core purpose, even under radically changed circumstances.<br> <br>With this in mind, consider how the Mexicans might have been spared their difficulties. Larger stockpiled reserves of corn, more diversified food crops, better real-time data, and better modeling of the impacts of U.S. corn crop diversion might obviously have helped; so too might a mechanism to rapidly secure alternative suppliers in a crisis, or restructuring the market to dampen the monopolies&#x2019; power, or investments in social programs for the poor to mitigate the effects of the price spike. Or one might just as readily have intervened in another point in the causal chain&#x2014;say, by diversifying U.S. energy production&#x2014;so that even a major hurricane wouldn&#x2019;t spur the diversion of corn to ethanol production in the first place.<br> <br>The strategies implied in each of these interventions&#x2014;ensuring that there are sufficient reserves available to any given system; or diversifying its inputs; or collecting better, real-time data about its operations and performance; or enabling greater autonomy for its constituent parts; or designing firebreaks so that a disturbance in one part does not disrupt the whole&#x2014;are, at their core, strategies of resilience. As we&#x2019;ll see, they can be applied at any scale, from whole civilizations to communities and organizations, to the lives of individual people.<br> <br>Defining resilience more precisely is complicated by the fact that different fields use the term to mean slightly different things. In engineering, resilience generally refers to the degree to which a structure like a bridge or a building can return to a baseline state after being disturbed. In emergency response, it suggests the speed with which critical systems can be restored after an earthquake or a flood. In ecology, it connotes an ecosystem&#x2019;s ability to keep from being irrevocably degraded. In psychology, it signifies the capacity of an individual to deal effectively with trauma. In business it&#x2019;s often used to mean putting in place backups (of data and resources) to ensure continuous operation in the face of natural or man-made disaster. Though different in emphasis, each of these definitions rests on one of two essential aspects of resilience: continuity and recovery in the face of change.<br> <br>Throughout this book, we will explore resilience in both systems and people. Accordingly, we frame resilience in terms borrowed from both ecology and sociology as the capacity of a system, enterprise, or a person to maintain its core purpose and integrity in the face of dramatically changed circumstances.<br> <br>To see what we mean, let&#x2019;s explore a metaphor used widely in resilience research. Imagine for a moment you are overlooking a vast landscape of imaginary hills and valleys, stretching out in every direction. Like something from a Borges fantasy, each valley in this panorama presents a significant variation on your present circumstance, an alternative reality with its own unique characteristics, opportunities, resources, and dangers. Each hill in this landscape can be thought of as the critical threshold or boundary separating these worlds&#x2014;once you pass its peak, you will, for good or ill, inexorably roll into the adjacent existential valley below. In some of these new circumstances, you may find life quite easy; in others, you may find things challenging; and in a few you may find your new reality so difficult that adaptation is all but impossible.<br> <br>As in real life, any number of sudden and serious disruptions might cause you to be &#x201c;flipped&#x201d; over the threshold separating your present context and a new one: Perhaps you experience a flood, or a drought, an invasion, or an earthquake, or perhaps your valley becomes too sparsely populated or too crowded to occupy. Perhaps your business encounters an economic or energy shock, a technological or competitive shift, a sudden shortage of raw materials, or the pricing in of environmental factors that were previously unaccounted for. Unfortunately, many of these thresholds may be crossed only in one direction: Once forces have compelled you into a new circumstance, it may be impossible for you to return to your prior environment. You&#x2019;ll have entered a new normal.<br> <br>To improve your resilience is to enhance your ability to resist being pushed from your preferred valley, while expanding the range of alternatives that you can embrace if you need to. This is what resilience researchers call preserving adaptive capacity&#x2014;the ability to adapt to changed circumstances while fulfilling one&#x2019;s core purpose&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s an essential skill in an age of unforeseeable disruption and volatility.<br> <br>There are, of course, many ways to expand your range of habitable niches. You could reduce your material needs in order to subsist in more resource-poor settings; you could learn to use a wider array of resources, so you could survive, MacGyver-like, on whatever might be locally available; you could invent a new technology, liberating yourself from a traditional constraint; you could modify tools designed for one niche to suit another; or you could learn to collaborate with the local d...</p><h2>The Mostly True Story of Jack</h2><p><b>Newbery Medal-winner Kelly Barnhill's debut novel is an eerie tale of magic, friendship, and sacrifice.</b><br><br>Enter a world where magic bubbles just below the surface. . . .<br><br>When Jack is sent to Hazelwood, Iowa, to live with his strange aunt and uncle, he expects a summer of boredom.

Sallust's abrupt and distinctive style is the perfect vehicle for his moral urgency, bitter condemnation, and satirical cynicism. William W. Batstone's new translation, which includes the fragmentary <em>Histories</em>, captures the severity of his Latin style. <em>Catiline's Conspiracy</em> describes the bloody rebellion led by the depraved and disaffected Catiline. For Sallust it was especially disturbing because of the unprecedented nature of the crime and the danger it caused. <em>The Jugurthine War</em> offers a graphic depiction of the war against the king of Numidia, highlighting the power struggles in Rome and the brutal battles in Africa. A wide-ranging introduction sets Sallust and his works in their turbulent historical context, and considers their achievements as both history and literature.

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Abu-Lughod lived with a community of Bedouins in the Western Desert of Egypt for nearly two years, studying gender relations, morality, and the oral lyric poetry through which women and young men express personal feelings. The poems are haunting, the evocation of emotional life vivid. But Abu-Lughod&#x2019;s analysis also reveals how deeply implicated poetry and sentiment are in the play of power and the maintenance of social hierarchy. What begins as a puzzle about a single poetic genre becomes a reflection on the politics of sentiment and the complexity of culture.<br> &nbsp;<br> This thirtieth anniversary edition includes a new afterword that reflects on developments both in anthropology and in the lives of this community of Awlad 'Ali Bedouins, who find themselves increasingly enmeshed in national political and social formations. The afterword ends with a personal meditation on the meaning&#x2014;for all involved&#x2014;of the radical experience of anthropological fieldwork and the responsibilities it entails for ethnographers.</p><p>&#x201c;A fascinating, fresh interpretation of the mechanics of the twin codes of Bedouin behavior: the &#x2018;code of honor&#x2019; . . . and the &#x2018;code of modesty.&#x2019; The argument is compelling&#x2014;it makes sense of honor killings, the veiling of women, and a seemingly excessive sexual modesty.

You cannot afford to be apolitical at work if you have any aspirations for advancement. The only way to avoid politics is to avoid people--by finding an out-of-the-way corner where you can do your job. Of course, it's the same job you'll likely be doing for the rest of your career. <br>In any job, when you reach a certain level of technical competence, politics is what makes all the difference with regard to success. At that point, it is indeed all politics. Everyday brilliant people take a backseat to their politically adept colleagues by failing to win crucial support for their ideas. Sometimes politics involves going around or bending rules, but more typically it's about positioning your ideas in a favorable light, and knowing what to say, and how and when to say it.... <br>Keep in mind that people benefit from perpetuating the image of politics as something you either know or you don't. Ignore them. Political acumen is largely learned from observation. And then it's a matter of practice, practice, practice. When a journalist suggested that golfing great Gary Player was very lucky, he replied: "It's funny, but the more I practice, the luckier I get."

The One who comes as visitor and guest becomes host and offers a hospitality in which the entire world can become truly human, be at home, and know salvation in the depths of their hearts.

It looks at the gospel as a whole, yet lingers upon scenes where the theme of hospitality is particularly prominent, such as the infancy stories, Jesus at Nazareth, Jesus in the house of Simon, the Good Samaritan, Martha and Mary, the banquet in 14:1-35, the Prodigal Son, Jesus' visit to the tax collector Zacchaeus, the institution of the Eucharist, and the Emmaus event.<br><br> This revised edition includes a new introductory chapter titled &#x201c;Features of Luke,&#x201d; which includes distinctive themes and motifs of the gospel that invite all to join in the life-giving hospitality of God.

Some, like the rockhopper penguin and a large fruit bat, can be shown in entirety, but many others, like a fully maned African lion and a long-tusked bewhiskered walrus, require foldout pages for even a partial view. The eye-catching photos are the main thrust, while extra data flows along the edges of the page, ranging from the most unangelic feeding behavior of the tiny Clione (aka sea angel) to demonstrating that bats do not hang upside down "when they pee or poop." Further data on size and global distribution decorate the endpapers. As in the original Life-Size Zoo, this is a great introduction to animals that most children encounter on a much-smaller-than-life TV screen.<i>Patricia Manning, formerly at Eastchester Public Library, NY</i><br>� Copyright 2010.

The format hasn&#x2019;t changed: a double-page spread offers a vivid photograph of an animal in actual-size dimension, which makes certain beasts seem scarier than ever (see the crocodile) or cuter than ever (see the baby gibbon). The routine is punctuated by &#x201c;wow&#x201d; moments, most notably in the few four-page foldouts, like the upper face&#x2014;that&#x2019;s all that fits!&#x2014;of a gigantic hippo.

(An Anastasia Krupnik story)</h2><p>Twelve-year-old Anastasia is horrified at her family&#39;s decision to move from their city apartment to a house in the suburbs.</p><p>"As soon as I finish this chocolate pudding, I'm going to jump out the window." Twelve-year-old Anastasia Krupnik has just discovered that her parents are planning a move to the suburbs. And she happens to know that people in the suburbs do not have meaningful paintings on their walls. They have paint-by-numbers pictures of kittens with big eyes playing with balls of yarn. And in the place of bookcases they have giant TV sets with bowls of fake fruit on top. One look at their future house in the suburbs, however, and Anastasia falls in love. It's not long before she's meeting the neighbors, including a handsome tennis player and a witch named Gertrude Stein. And it takes hardly any time at all before she's immersed in just the kind of complicated messes that she seems to specialize in. <p> Award-winning author Lois Lowry has an undeniable knack for knowing the minds of young people, from Anastasia's 2-year-old brother in <i>All About Sam</i> to the 10-year-old <i>Anastasia Krupnik</i> to the precocious preteen character in this engaging novel.

That short distance produces more divergence than one might think. If both cities were apples, Dallas would be sliced and resting on a bed of arugula and kale with some nice vinaigrette, while Fort Worth would be sitting in a bin at the Farmer's Market behind a sign that reads, "These are good old apples. If you're looking for kale, Dallas is over there." In childhood Bill came to love fiction late, preferring history and science books instead. In his mid-teens he discovered science fiction and fantasy novels, particularly Roger Zelazny, Ursula Le Guin, Robert Heinlein, J.R.R. Tolkien, Robert E. Howard, Harry Harrison, Marion Zimmer Bradley, Richard Brautigan, Robert Saberhagen, Piers Anthony, and Gordon R. Dickson. Michael Moorcock was also a favorite. Bill inhaled all five Elric books in one day while home with a bad cold. More recently he has particularly enjoyed the work of Christopher Moore, Orson Scott Card, Neil Gaiman, John Steakley, and Sir Terry Pratchett. Death's Collector is Bill's first published novel, to be followed by Wee Piggies of Radiant Might and Death's Book of Tricks, all part of "The Death-Cursed Wizard" series. Three unpublished novels preceded Death's Collector, all of which he loves like children despite their irredeemable flaws. Bill earned a M.A. in Sociology from the University of Texas at Arlington. (Arlington lies halfway between Fort Worth and Dallas. The implications may best be imagined.) The most important thing he learned in college is that nobody is under any obligation to teach him anything, including professors. Especially professors, since they've attended classes on how to look down upon the uneducated. That detail may be fabricated, but the principle stands. People have paid Bill to do an odd variety of things, including construction, market research, acting, and managing software projects. He lives with his four cats, who are aspiring internet celebrities, and his lovely wife, a woman so keenly determined that she would always be able to kill him if it came to a knife fight.<br><br>ShaylaRaquel.com<br><br>TheThatchery.com</p><h2>Canon of the Five Orders of Architecture (Dover Architecture)</h2><p>One of history's most published architectural treatises, this Renaissance volume solidified the architectural canon of the past five centuries.

According to architectural historian Philippa Lewis, a portal "is generally an optimistic thing, both literally and metaphorically . . . The word encapsulates the idea of passing through, to a new opportunity, to making progress or moving forward, to entering fresh new worlds."</p><p>That may be the reason so many people are drawn to the idea of portals--from King Nebuchadnezzar's Ishtar Gate through the walls of Babylon, to mountain passes, the doorway to the Raphael Loggia at the Vatican, pontoons, and drawbridges. Portals also have enlivened fiction and lore--what would <i>Arabian Nights</i> have been without the magical command "Open Sesame!" or <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> if Alice had not followed the White Rabbit down a rabbit hole? And in many cultures around the world, a rainbow is a portal that "stands for peace, tolerance, respect for life and diversity."

She is always sweeping her burrow, polishing and tidying. It is an endless job and it seems that no sooner has she made a good start than another messy visitor appears to leave their muddy footprints everywhere.

Albee&#x2019;s frank dialogue about everything from incontinence to infidelity portrays aging without sentimentality. His scenes are charged with wit, pain, and laughter, and his observations tell us about forgiveness, reconciliation, and our own fates. But it is his probing portrait of the three women that reveals Albee&#x2019;s genius. Separate characters on stage in the first act, yet actually the same &#x201c;everywoman&#x201d; at different ages in the second act, these &#x201c;tall women&#x201d; lay bare the truths of our lives&#x2014;how we live, how we love, what we settle for, and how we die. Edward Albee has given theatergoers, critics, and students of drama reason to rejoice.</p><p><b>Edward Albee</b>, the American dramatist, was born in 1928. He has written and directed some of the best plays in contemporary American theatre and three of his plays: <i>A Delicate Balance</i>, <i>Seascape</i> and <i>Three Tall Women</i> have received Pulitzer Prizes. His most famous play, <i>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</i> won the New York Drama Critics Circle Award for Best Play. His other plays include <i>The Zoo Story, The Death of Bessie Smith, The Sandbox, The American Dream, Tiny Alice, All Over, Listening, The Lady from Dubuque, The Man Who Had Three Arms, Finding the Sun, Fragments, Marriage Play</i> and <i>The Lorca Play</i>.Albee's best plays have always walked a line between heightened realism and dark comedy. Even his most surreal works are populated with characters who wouldn't seem out of place in real life. His 1994 Pulitzer Prize winner runs true to form. It begins as a naturalistic conversation among three women (identified as A, B, and C) from successive generations who meet in a hospital room. Each is undergoing a change from one life phase to another, and each faces her travails and disappointments with lots of Albee's trademark bitter wit. In the second act, however, the three women become representatives of the same person at different ages (26, 52, late 80s), and their bickering talk becomes a touching internal colloquy about life, love, and the inevitability of loss. Not since Beckett's brooding meditation <i>Krapp's Last Tape</i> has a playwright dealt so movingly with the subject of disappointment, aging, and death. <i>Jack Helbig</i></p><h2>Iron and Magic (1) (Iron Covenant)</h2><p><p><em>The Iron Covenant Book 1</em><br> <br> <strong>No day is ordinary in a world where Technology and Magic compete for supremacy...But no matter which force is winning, in the apocalypse, a sword will always work.</strong><br> <br> Hugh d&#x2019;Ambray, Preceptor of the Iron Dogs, Warlord of the Builder of Towers, served only one man.

There, I underwent a life-changing experience. As I walked the beaches with the American veterans who had returned for this anniversary, men in their sixties and seventies, and listened to their stories, I was deeply moved and profoundly grateful for all they had done. Ten years later, I returned to Normandy for the fiftieth anniversary of the invasion, and by then I had come to understand what this generation of Americans meant to history. It is, I believe, the greatest generation any society has ever produced."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>In this superb book, Tom Brokaw goes out into America, to tell through the stories of individual men and women the story of a generation, America's citizen heroes and heroines who came of age during the Great Depression and the Second World War and went on to build modern America. This generation was united not only by a common purpose, but also by common values--duty, honor, economy, courage, service, love of family and country, and, above all, responsibility for oneself. In this book, you will meet people whose everyday lives reveal how a generation persevered through war, and were trained by it, and then went on to create interesting and useful lives and the America we have today.<br><br>"At a time in their lives when their days and nights should have been filled with innocent adventure, love, and the lessons of the workaday world, they were fighting in the most primitive conditions possible across the bloodied landscape of France, Belgium, Italy, Austria, and the coral islands of the Pacific. They answered the call to save the world from the two most powerful and ruthless military machines ever assembled, instruments of conquest in the hands of fascist maniacs. They faced great odds and a late start, but they did not protest. They succeeded on every front. They won the war; they saved the world. They came home to joyous and short-lived celebrations and immediately began the task of rebuilding their lives and the world they wanted. They married in record numbers and gave birth to another distinctive generation, the Baby Boomers. A grateful nation made it possible for more of them to attend college than any society had ever educated, anywhere. They gave the world new science, literature, art, industry, and economic strength unparalleled in the long curve of history. As they now reach the twilight of their adventurous and productive lives, they remain, for the most part, exceptionally modest. They have so many stories to tell, stories that in many cases they have never told before, because in a deep sense they didn't think that what they were doing was that special, because everyone else was doing it too.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"This book, I hope, will in some small way pay tribute to those men and women who have given us the lives we have today--an American family portrait album of the greatest generation."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>In this book you'll meet people like Charles Van Gorder, who set up during D-Day a MASH-like medical facility in the middle of the fighting, and then came home to create a clinic and hospital in his hometown. You'll hear George Bush talk about how, as a Navy Air Corps combat pilot, one of his assignments was to read the mail of the enlisted men under him, to be sure no sensitive military information would be compromised. And so, Bush says, "I learned about life." You'll meet Trudy Elion, winner of the Nobel Prize in medicine, one of the many women in this book who found fulfilling careers in the changed society as a result of the war. You'll meet Martha Putney, one of the first black women to serve in the newly formed WACs.

Narrating his own book, he discusses the sacrifices those men and women made: the bodily harm they suffered in war, the diligence with which they built families and businesses, the courage they displayed in rehabilitating their war wounds, the integrity and values that infused their lives. "They never whined or whimpered," Brokaw notes. The stories these men and women tell Brokaw are consistently startling--triumphant, tragic, courageous, sad, miraculous. Although Brokaw never gets maudlin or sappy, most people will find it impossible to listen to this audiobook with dry eyes.

With <i>This Common Secret</i>, Dr. Susan Wicklund chronicles her twenty-year career in the vanguard of the abortion war. Growing up in working-class rural Wisconsin, Susan made the painful decision to have an abortion at a young age. It was not until she became a doctor that she realized how many women shared her ordeal of an unwanted pregnancy...and how hidden this common experience remains.<br>Now, in this raw and riveting true story, Susan and the patients she's treated share the complex, anguished, and empowering emotions that drove their own choices. Hers is a calling that means sleeping on planes and commuting between clinics in different states--and that requires her to wear a bulletproof vest and to carry a .38 caliber revolver. <i>This Common Secret</i> reveals the truth about the reproductive health clinics that anti-abortion activists mischaracterize as damaging and unsafe. This intimate memoir explains how social stigma and restrictive legislation can isolate women who are facing difficult personal choices--and how we as a nation can, and must, support them.</p><p><b>Susan Wicklund </b>has worked in the field of women's reproductive health for more than twenty years. For much of that time she has been on the front lines of the abortion war, both as a doctor and as a spokeswoman for women's rights. She has been interviewed by numerous leading media outlets, including<b> </b><i>60 Minutes</i> and "Fresh Air."<b><br><br>Alan Kesselheim </b>is a full-time freelance writer from Bozeman, Montana. <i>This Common Secret</i> is his ninth book.<p>Reviewed by Emily Bazelon</p><p>In the 35 years since Roe v. Wade, human stories and hard science have been the dueling weapons of the abortion wars. Abortion opponents have presented emotional accounts of the destruction of fetuses -- and, more recently, tales of distress from women who regret their abortions. Supporters of legal abortion have often countered with data on the decline in backstreet abortions and improvements in women's health and welfare. </p><p> So it's a welcome change to see two new books in which the pro-life and pro-choice camps switch their usual tactics. In This Common Secret, Susan Wicklund tells riveting stories about patients she has treated during nearly 20 years as an abortion provider. Meanwhile, in Embryo, Robert P. George and Christopher Tollefsen argue on scientific and philosophical grounds that from its first moment as a one-cell organism, the embryo is a living human being and, thus, entitled to legal protection. If Wicklund's book is the more effective, perhaps that's because she's not claiming to prove one objective truth, just conveying her own experience -- and because she has good, multifaceted stories to tell. </p><p>As a 26-year-old single mother working part-time and getting by on welfare and food stamps, Susan Wicklund became one of the first members of her large Wisconsin family to go to college. Before she decided to become a doctor and specialize in women's health, she had her own abortion to surmount -- a 1976 procedure that she did not understand, and that she sobbed and fought her way through until a doctor told her to shut up and drugged her. This horror story could come straight out of an anti-abortion pamphlet were it not for the determination Wicklund drew from it as she began medical school: "I could make sure my patients were treated differently than I had been -- with respect and decency. The memory of my own abortion troubled me, but it also hardened my resolve." </p><p>Such clear-eyed depictions of abortion services, and the close-up descriptions of the women Wicklund has treated, are the source of the book's power. This is a doctor who spent years working 100-hour weeks, crisscrossing the West to reach remote clinics and pregnant women. Over the years, Wicklund endured stalking and physical threats. She wore a bulletproof vest and carried a gun. One desperate morning in 1991, she woke to the sound of protesters chanting, "Susan kills babies!" outside her rural home. They stayed for weeks; Wicklund's daughter had to ride to school in a police car. And her marriage fell victim to the work and strain. "I have to recognize the truth," she writes. "My commitments have demanded a great deal from the people I love." </p><p>Her zeal is not for simple abortion on demand, but for medical care that ends in abortion only when both doctor and patient are sure of that choice. "My biggest fear has always been to do an abortion on someone who will later come to regret it," she writes. When she is afraid a woman is being coerced or has doubts, Wicklund says, she sends the woman away. In her book, Wicklund prints a grateful letter from one such patient. And she tells the story of a patient who opted for abortion because she'd thought she'd conceived through a rape, only to grieve inconsolably when she realized she'd mistaken the timing of her pregnancy. </p><p>These are not typical stories, and Wicklund does not present them as such. But she uses them to underscore the importance of counseling, which she describes as the biggest economic challenge of abortion practice, since it's hard to recoup the costs from insurers. And Wicklund's sensitivity to the fraught nature of abortion, as some women experience it, makes her stories of the damage wrought by the "antis," as she calls them, more credible and vivid. On the satisfied customer side of the ledger, she counts a prim woman who let loose a terrific scream of joy when assured she was no longer pregnant. And to illustrate the hassle of state-imposed restrictions, Wicklund describes a teenager who missed days of school and had to wait a month because of a state parental consent law, and a woman who lost her job because of the multiple visits necessitated by a mandated 24-hour waiting period. </p><p>George and Tollefsen's prose is dryer than Wicklund's because of the nature of their project. The authors -- George is a Princeton professor of jurisprudence and member of the President's Council on Bioethics, and Tollefsen a philosophy professor at the University of South Carolina -- set out to prove that "a human embryo is a whole living member of the species Homo sapiens in the earliest stage of his or her natural development." As such, from the moment of fertilization, the embryo deserves full moral respect as well as "the rights that people possess simply by virtue of their humanity." George and Tollefsen deliberately set aside religion in making their case, relying instead on the classic tools of philosophical proof. </p><p>The first steps of their argument are fairly unassailable -- sperm fertilizes egg, and a pencil-point-sized embryo, or zygote, is formed "fully programmed" to become a baby nine months later (assuming no missteps along the way). But can science or philosophy prove that this zygote has the same moral claim to legal status as any member of the "human family," such that the destruction of embryos in the service of stem cell research is akin to Nazi experiments on the mentally retarded? </p><p>The "living Homo sapiens" language that George and Tollefsen defend has been adopted by the legislature of South Dakota and is the subject of a legal challenge that may end up before the Supreme Court. The judges who have ruled in the case so far reject the notion that the status of the embryo can be objectively resolved by science. George and Tollefsen's book probably won't change their minds.</p><p>Here's an example that illustrates why. Harvard professor Michael Sandel, one of the authors' academic sparring partners, has posed this hypothetical: Suppose you're escaping from a building that's on fire, and you have to choose between saving a crate of frozen embryos and a 5-year-old girl -- which do you rescue? George and Tollefsen have to admit that most people would save the girl. But they insist that if the rescuer were the parent or grandparent of the embryos, he "might well choose to rescue them, and most people would not regard this as immoral." </p><p>Really? Is this an accurate representation of the moral stance of "most people," or a mirror that George and Tollefsen are holding up to themselves? Last fall, scientists in the United States and Japan announced they had reprogrammed adult cells to give them the qualities of embryonic cells that are so valued in stem cell research. This development takes the urgency out of George and Tollefsen's plea -- and most people would probably agree that if it leaves us with less to fight over in this arena, so much the better. But if science helps ease the embryo debate, it will be for reasons that these authors don't anticipate. </p><p></p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

The book opens with narratives of five Sufis met by the author in Syria, Jordan, and Turkey whose lives exemplified the knowledge and practice of the Sufi path. The second part is a complete handbook of the method and rule of the Shadhili order of Sufism, transmitted to the author by his spiritual mentor, Sheikh &#39;Abd al-Rahman al-Shaghouri--from devotions, dhikr or &#39;invocation,&#39; and metaphysical doctrine, to how a Sufi lives, marries, and earns a living in the modern world. A third part treats wider theological questions such as other faiths and mysticisms, universalism and the finality of Islam, the promise of God to Jews and Christians, evolution and religion, and divine Wisdom and Justice in the face of human suffering. The book provides an indelible portrait of a vibrant mystical tradition spanning seven and a half centuries of endeavor to know the Divine face-to-face. Sheikh Nuh Keller was born in the US in 1954. He read philosophy and classical Arabic at the University of Chicago and UCLA, and became a Muslim in Cairo in 1977. He was authorized as a sheikh in the Shadhili order by Sheikh &#39;Abd al-Rahman in 1996 and is the leading authority on traditional Islam in the West. He has studied jurisprudence, hadith, and other subjects with traditional scholars, produced Reliance of the Traveller, the 1st translation of a standard Islamic legal reference in a English to be certified by al-Azhar, the Muslim world&#39;s oldest institution of higher learning. Among his other works and translations are Sufism in Islam, al-Maqasid: Imam Nawawi&#39;s Manual of Islam, Port in a Storm, and an illuminated calligraphic edition of Dala&#39;il al-Khayrat.</p><p></p><h2>Negotiating Critical Literacies with Young Children: 10th Anniversary Edition (Language, Culture, and Teaching Series)</h2><p><p>In this innovative and engaging text, Vivian Maria Vasquez draws on her own classroom experience to demonstrate how issues raised from everyday conversations with pre-kindergarten children can be used to create an integrated critical literacy curriculum over the course of one school year.

If so, did their conversion lead to freedom? If not, then how could perpetual enslavement be justified? In <i>Christian Slavery</i>, Katharine Gerbner contends that religion was fundamental to the development of both slavery and race in the Protestant Atlantic world. Slave owners in the Caribbean and elsewhere established governments and legal codes based on an ideology of "Protestant Supremacy," which excluded the majority of enslaved men and women from Christian communities. For slaveholders, Christianity was a sign of freedom, and most believed that slaves should not be eligible for conversion.</p><p>When Protestant missionaries arrived in the plantation colonies intending to convert enslaved Africans to Christianity in the 1670s, they were appalled that most slave owners rejected the prospect of slave conversion. Slaveholders regularly attacked missionaries, both verbally and physically, and blamed the evangelizing newcomers for slave rebellions. In response, Quaker, Anglican, and Moravian missionaries articulated a vision of "Christian Slavery," arguing that Christianity would make slaves hardworking and loyal.</p><p>Over time, missionaries increasingly used the language of race to support their arguments for slave conversion. Enslaved Christians, meanwhile, developed an alternate vision of Protestantism that linked religious conversion to literacy and freedom. <i>Christian Slavery</i> shows how the contentions between slave owners, enslaved people, and missionaries transformed the practice of Protestantism and the language of race in the early modern Atlantic world.</p></p><p>Katharine Gerbner teaches history at the University of Minnesota.<p>Introduction</p><p>On November 16, 1651, a man named Lazarus entered the Anglican church in Christ Church parish, Barbados. As he walked toward the church doors, he passed the "strong pair of Stocks" where public punishments took place. The church itself was a wooden structure and one of the oldest buildings on the island. Constructed in 1629 just two years after the first English settlers arrived, the church would meet a tempestuous end: it was destroyed by flood in 1669 and washed out to sea. The second and third iterations of the church were destroyed by hurricane. But before the first church structure met its watery demise, it served as the site of Lazarus's baptism. Lazarus, who was described only as "a negro" in the church register, was the first Afro-Caribbean to receive baptism in the Anglican Church on Barbados. Neither his age nor place of birth were given, nor any indication of godparents or kin.</p><p>Lazarus's baptism challenged the emerging culture of slavery in the Protestant Caribbean. The Anglican Church in Barbados was exclusive, the domain of slave owners and government officials. While most historians have downplayed the relevance of institutionalized Christianity in the seventeenth-century Protestant Caribbean, viewing the sugar colonies as islands of depravity, the Anglican Church was central to the maintenance of planter power in Barbados and elsewhere. The Anglo-Barbadian elite believed that their status as Protestants was inseparable from their identity as free Englishmen. Like their counterparts in England, they purchased pews, memorialized themselves within church walls, and used the church as a place for both punishment and politics. Aside from the stocks that sat outside its doors, the church was the site of island elections and served as a community bulletin board where white inhabitants could post news about stolen goods or runaway slaves.</p><p>Unlike the parish churches in England, however, the Anglican Church in Barbados was restricted. It separated masters from their enslaved "heathen" laborers and marked Anglo-Barbadians as both English and free. The association between Protestantism and freedom was so strong that most slave owners came to dismiss the idea that their slaves were eligible for conversion. In 1661, when the British Parliament instructed Lord Willoughby, the reinstated governor of Barbados, to "[win] such as are purchased . . . as slaves to the Christian faith and [make] them capable of being baptized thereinto," the Assembly and Council refused to pass Willoughby's 1663 bill "recommending the christening of Negro children, and the instruction of all adult Negroes, to the several ministers of this place." By 1680, the Barbadian planters' stance against slave conversion had become even more pronounced. When William Blathwayt, on behalf of the Lords of Trade and Plantations in London, wrote to the merchants of Barbados to inquire as to "the unhappy state of the negroes and other slaves in Barbadoes by their not being admitted to the Christian religion," the self-titled "gentlemen of Barbados" explained that "the conversion of their slaves to Christianity would not only destroy their property but endanger the island, inasmuch as converted negroes grow more perverse and intractable than others."</p><p>Anticonversion sentiment was one of the defining features of Protestant slave societies in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. While enslaved Africans in Spanish, French, and Portuguese colonial societies were regularly introduced to Catholicism and baptized, whether willingly or not, Protestant slave owners in the English, Dutch, and Danish colonies tended to view conversion as inconsistent or incompatible with slavery. Their anticonversion sentiment was indicative of the changing meaning of Protestantism in the American colonies: over the course of the seventeenth century, Protestant planters claimed Christian identity for themselves, creating an exclusive ideal of religion based on ethnicity&#x2014;a construct that I call "Protestant Supremacy."</p><p>Protestant Supremacy was the predecessor of White Supremacy, an ideology that emerged after the codification of racial slavery. I refer to "Protestant" Supremacy, rather than "Anglican" or "Christian" Supremacy, because this ideology was present throughout the Protestant American colonies, from the Danish West Indies to Virginia and beyond. It was most likely to develop in places with an enslaved population that was larger than the free population, such as Barbados, Jamaica, or South Carolina. In these colonies, Anglican, Dutch Reformed, and Lutheran slave owners conceived of their Protestant identities as fundamental to their status as masters. They constructed a caste system based on Christian status, in which "heathenish" slaves were afforded no rights or privileges while Catholics, Jews, and nonconforming Protestants were viewed with suspicion and distrust, but granted more protections.</p><p>When Protestant missionaries arrived in the plantation colonies intending to convert enslaved Africans to Christianity in the 1670s, they encountered slave societies that had already developed churches founded on exclusion. Planters regularly attacked missionaries, both verbally and physically, and blamed the evangelizing newcomers for slave rebellions, regardless of evidence to the contrary. Missionaries responded to this hostile environment by articulating and promoting a vision of "Christian Slavery" that reconciled Protestantism with bondage.</p><p>"Christian Slavery" was a polysemic concept. At the most basic level, it was an attempt to Christianize and reform slavery. Protestant theologians and missionaries drew on biblical descriptions of slavery as well as the ideal of the godly household to encourage slave owners to assume responsibility for the spiritual lives of their enslaved laborers. They also noted that Christian slavery had a long and well-established history in Europe and the Catholic American colonies. As missionaries faced opposition from slave owners, however, the meaning of "Christian Slavery" shifted. Missionaries increasingly emphasized the beneficial aspects of slave conversion, arguing that Christian slaves would be more docile and harder working than their "heathen" counterparts. They also sought to pass legislation that confirmed the legality of owning enslaved Christians. Over time, they integrated race into their arguments for Christian slavery. Since the ideology of Protestant Supremacy used religion to differentiate between slavery and freedom, missionaries suggested that race, rather than religion, was the defining feature of bondage.</p><p>Protestant missions to enslaved people have traditionally been examined within the context of antislavery thought, and have often been evaluated on humanitarian terms. During the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, however, it is more accurate to understand the conflict between missionaries and slave owners as a clash between Protestant Supremacy, which excluded enslaved people from Christianity, and Christian Slavery, which sought to include slaves within the Protestant community. In this period before the abolitionist and proslavery movements of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, it is possible to see the early Protestant debates about Christianity and slavery in a new light. In contrast to historians who have studied the origins of antislavery, I emphasize the ways that Quaker, Anglican, and Moravian missionaries fought hard to accommodate slavery to their Christian principles and argue that their efforts bore fruit in legislation affirming that Protestant status was compatible with perpetual bondage. As a result, their advocacy should be understood within the long history of proslavery thought as well as an antecedent of antislavery and abolition.</p><p>The tendency to read abolition into the early Protestant missions is especially pronounced in the Quaker historiography. Very little has been written on Quaker slaveholding practices in their own right, rather than as a prelude for abolition. Quaker founder George Fox's feelings on slavery, for example, are usually considered within the context of antislavery. A transatlantic, interdenominational understanding of seventeenth-century Quaker ideas about slavery reveals something different. With a large community of slave-owning Friends in Barbados, Quakers were among the first Protestants to think seriously about how slaveholding would affect Christian practice. Their ideas, publications, and pro-conversion stance affected not only the Society of Friends, but also members of other Protestant denominations. Furthermore, their publications did not lead solely to antislavery thought; their influence can be found in the developing rhetoric of paternalism and Christian slavery as well.</p><p>Unlike the Quakers, Anglicans and Moravians were not leaders in the eighteenth-century abolitionist movement. Regardless, many scholars have read a humanitarian impulse into their early missionary ventures. Recently, this approach has come under critique. Most notably, historians have shown that missionary Anglicanism was responsible for a series of laws and opinions that strengthened slavery in order to encourage slave conversion. I support and expand this critique by incorporating Quakers, Anglicans, and Moravians into an interdenominational study. The first Anglican publications on slavery were spurred, in part, by Quaker polemics, and both imperial and denominational rivalry played a major role in determining the objectives of the Anglican Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG). Similarly, the Moravians were in close contact with Anglican churchmen in the 1730s, and had a complicated relationship with members of the SPG and the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge (SPCK). Far from anticipating an antislavery position, these Protestant missionaries articulated and circulated a vision for Christian slavery that laid the groundwork for the proslavery apologists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.</p><p>Interdenominational rivalry and communication networks played an important role in this story. Quakers were the first Protestant group to advocate for slave conversion and as they increased their missionary efforts, they attacked the Anglican Church for its failure to act. As Anglicans and Quakers became involved in a print war over the relationship between Protestantism and slavery, Anglicans moved to establish their own evangelizing presence in the New World. While Anglican progress was slow, the growing international network of missionaries made it easier for the Moravians, who were in contact with members of the SPG in England, to join the evangelizing effort in the 1730s.</p><p>The Protestant Caribbean was a geographical center of these debates. Both Quaker and Moravian missions began in the West Indies, while the SPG was active in early eighteenth-century Barbados. Missionaries who began their work in the Caribbean traveled throughout the colonies and published polemical pamphlets on both sides of the Atlantic. Missionaries communicated with imperials officials in London and Copenhagen and with their own church headquarters. Quakers initially addressed all correspondence to Swarthmore Hall, the home of Margaret Fell Fox, while they later made the London Yearly Meeting their central administrative body. Anglican missionaries communicated with the Secretary of the SPG and the Bishop of London, while the Moravians exchanged letters and diaries with the church leadership in Herrnhut, Germany, and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.</p><p>The transatlantic network of Protestant missionaries crossed both imperial and confessional lines. Some missionaries, particularly within the Moravian Church, traveled between the Danish colonies in the West Indies and the British colonies of North America. Others, such as the French Huguenots who became Anglican missionaries, had intimate knowledge of Catholic practice regarding slavery. In the Caribbean, some islands like St. Christopher were split into French Catholic and English Protestant sections, making interimperial and interconfessional comparisons especially poignant. These imperial and confessional borderlands show that Protestant ideas about slavery often emerged in relation to Catholic practice. Protestant missionaries were simultaneously envious and dismissive of the large numbers of enslaved and free blacks baptized in the Catholic Church. They denigrated Catholic baptism as meaningless and criticized Catholic missionaries and priests for failing to truly educate enslaved people in Christian doctrine.</p><p>Protestant missionaries and black Christians created an extensive, multilingual archive about slavery and Christianity in the Protestant American colonies. The Moravian sources, which are written primarily in German, Dutch, and Dutch Creole, are a particularly rich resource for understanding daily life in the Caribbean and North America. The Moravian records promise to redefine scholarly understanding of black Christian practice but they have been underutilized by both Anglophone and German-speaking scholars because they are written in <i>S�tterlin</i>, an archaic form of German script. In addition to the diaries, letters, and church registers kept by missionaries, the Moravian archives include a small number of letters written by enslaved and free Afro-Caribbean converts&#x2014;some of the only such documents available for the period. These documents give scholars the extremely rare opportunity to analyze the texts written by, rather than about, Afro-Caribbean men and women in the eighteenth century. I use these sources to better understand when and why enslaved and free Africans chose to engage in Christian rituals in the Protestant Caribbean. I also compare diaries written by different missionaries in order to paint a multiperspectival picture of mission culture and everyday life.</p><p>The Quaker and Anglican sources do not match the Moravian sources in the detail or volume of their observations about Afro-Protestant practice. As a result, I have turned to social historical methods, in addition to other strategies, to get a sense of broad, demographic patterns relating to the participation of enslaved and free Africans in Quaker and Anglican rituals. Besides reading letters written by missionaries, I have analyzed the baptismal and marital registers for Anglican churches, Quaker meeting minutes, and governmental and official records, including wills, censuses, and official correspondence. Still, the chapters on Quaker and Anglican missions focus more heavily on transatlantic debates <i>about</i> slave conversion, rather than an analysis <i>of</i> slave conversion itself. Yet these two topics&#x2014;the transatlantic debate and the actual decisions of enslaved and free Africans to participate in Christian rituals&#x2014;are inextricably connected. Only by examining everyday life in the Protestant plantation colonies <i>and</i> the broader debate regarding slave conversion is it possible to gain a full understanding of the Atlantic dimensions of Protestant missions and slave conversion in the early modern world.</p><p>At the heart of this inquiry is the concept of "conversion," a term that must be used with caution. There are two central criticisms of the term. First, some scholars have suggested that it falsely implies that converts abandoned one belief syst...</p></p><h2>Still the Mind: An Introduction to Meditation</h2><p>Mark Watts compiled this book from his father&#x2019;s extensive journals and audiotapes of famous lectures he delivered across the country. In three parts, Alan Watts -- the author of The Way of Zen and The Joyous Cosmology -- explains the basic philosophy of meditation, how individuals can practice a variety of meditations, and how inner wisdom grows naturally.</p><p>Meditation guru Alan Watts was recorded in the 1970s giving talks on emptying the mind of worry, stress, and guilt. With eloquent yet spontaneous, practical language, the author says real living is possible when we attend to the moments between thoughts, the moments we usually fill with clutter. This emotional busyness stems from the illusion that we have important responsibilities--that things will fall apart without our constant attention. By accepting a more humble place in the universe, we become more fully interactive with the energy of the universe and become a more effective channel for what it wants us to do. Watts's work is a marvelous and historically significant chapter in the development of American Buddhism and the meditative life.

I have been suffering from IBS and SIBO for years .... I came across your "gut health protocol" and followed it to a T... and I truly have not felt this good in years !!!!!! You have given me my life back !!!!! I never realized how sick I was, and I forgot how a healthy person should feel. I thought I had to live my life feeling the way I did. Not the case at all !! To everyone out there.... read the gut protocol, follow what is suggested...its so worth it !!!&#x201d; &#x2014; Jackie A.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I've been doing John's protocol for the last two months and it has helped immensely with my SIBO. My bloating and stomach distention are pretty much gone, ditto stools pretty much normal and motility much better.&nbsp; I'm not necessarily 100% better, but it's the first thing I've done beside a ridiculously restrictive diet that has actually helped me heal. In fact, previously my diet was slowly becoming more and more restricted. Give it a try, it's good stuff. And, hey John Herron, thank you!&#x201d; &#x2014; Michelle M.</p><p>&#x201c;I would like to share that I have had such great success. My gut is probably about 90% better. I realize that it still probably has issues and this is a journey of healing and keeping it well, but I have had no bloating, belching, constipation or diarrhea, and limited moments of soreness. I feel that I am digesting my food and the shortness of breath, heart palpitations, and discomfort in my throat are gone too.&#x201d; &#x2014; Berea F.</p><p>&#x201c;I just looked at your latest protocol and I have to say it is totally amazing! It seems more thorough than most of the 5 books I have read. Were/are you something famous for your job?&#x201d; &#x2014; Debbie H.</p><p>The Gut Health Protocol outlines natural approaches to tackling dozens of stomach and intestinal health issues using only scientifically studied natural herbs, supplements and diet. Supplements commonly available in local health foods stores and at your favorite online retailer. Many common ailments often have gut issues as their underlying cause, conditions such as: recurring stomach aches, diarrhea, constipation, heartburn, IBS, acid reflux, nausea, eating disorders, eczema, obesity, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and even major depression have all been linked to gut issues. The root of many of these problems can often be traced quite convincingly to Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO), intestinal candida albicans, h.pylori bacteria overgrowth in the stomach, bacterial dysbiosis throughout the gut or other secondary conditions that these infections cause. The Gut Health Protocol can usually resolve these issues, and without damaging antibiotics or steroids. Even if you choose to go the antibiotic route The Gut Health Protocol can make the treatment more effective and can help prevent serious complications.</p><p>Over 1200 published scientific studies are summarized and explained in easy to understand language, over 500 pages long. Unlike many self-help books nearly everything in the book is based on science, not opinion. The author takes all of this brilliant research and translates it to the practical application of healing and caring for our gut.</p><p>The book is written in such a way as allow your doctor to easily look up the research to validate the claims and treatment suggestions. No need to take the author&#x2019;s word for anything, you and your doctor can read the research. It is recommended that everyone works with a doctor to determine a treatment plan.</p><p>Though everyone&#x2019;s condition is different, you can be feeling much better in as little as 2 weeks, naturally and without risky antibiotics.</p><p><strong>Be sure visit The Gut Health Protocol support group on Facebook, there are thousands of members just like you, all helping each other.</strong></p></p><p>John Herron thinks of himself as a &#x201c;meta-researcher&#x201d;, a person who researches the research. He doesn&#x2019;t do medical studies, he finds them, digests them, and translates them for his readers. John began this meta-research not out of desire, but necessity. He had been sick for many years with intestinal, stomach, and various other issues that doctors were helpless to cure. Thus he began doing his own research, not browsing the thousands of self-help websites, but scouring published medical and scientific research studies. This meta-research led him to not only find many potentially helpful natural supplements that had great potential to eliminate gut infections, but also to herbs and foods that can heal the damage done by these infections. What resulted was a new understanding of what needed to be done, and in what order, to heal his own health issues, a healing protocol. John started sharing this information with some people he met on Facebook that had similar issues, many of them, on their own accord, started testing his theories and reporting back. When their results matched his own experiences he knew he was on to something. This resulted in his first book, &#x201c;The Gut Health Protocol&#x201d;. John continues to research other health conditions and sharing his research with thousands of people in the Facebook group &#x201c;The Gut Health Protocol&#x201d;. Many of the research studies have been tested in the lab, are safe and effective, but have never been used in medical practice. The reasons are simple, there are no drug companies willing to sell a product that has very little profit potential, products that would possibly cripple the sales of their existing medications. John hopes to write additional books in the future, with the hope that results of this meta-research leads more people to discover natural cures for common ailments. Ailments that modern pharmaceuticals may not have all the answers or may have serious side effects.</p><h2>The Detox Diet, Third Edition: The Definitive Guide for Lifelong Vitality with Recipes, Menus, and Detox Plans</h2><p><b>This fully updated edition of&nbsp;<i>The Detox Diet</i>&nbsp;guides readers&nbsp;through the detoxification process and follow-up cleansing programs&nbsp;developed by Dr. Elson Haas for those struggling with&nbsp;addictions to sugar, caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol.</b><br><br>&#x25a0;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you overeat?

Of course, there are many other practitioners who guide and observe people through similar processes of elimination diets, detoxification programs, and juice cleansing and have thousands of positive anecdotes. We still do not have much research that backs up what we see. It is challenging to first study the multi-dimensional programs people typically employ and then compare them with placebos or different diets. This research gold standard (double-blind, placebo-controlled study) is much easier when evaluating one substance, like a new medicine. <br> Really, we are talking here about a complete lifestyle shift, as with diet, exercise activities, and attitudes. Thus, to skeptics, it&#x2019;s all a bunch of talk. &#x201c;Prove to me that it works,&#x201d; states a scientific researcher. I say, &#x201c;Let me put you on a program and we&#x2019;ll see how you feel and look.

Here, experience and anecdote might be a better gold standard.<br> &nbsp; We have expanded the recipe options from the original version of The Detox Diet because we want to give you more tasty choices for foods you can consume during and after detox. The following recipes are examples of foods you can eat coming off your detox program as well as some you can even consume while on your detox. We have organized them into breakfast; lunch and dinner; soups, salads, and side dishes; sauces, dips and dressings; snacks and treats; hot and cold drinks; smoothies; and fresh vegetable and fruit juices for easier access and application to your diet.<br> Part of the detoxification process is following an alkaline diet to help balance the acidic body state, which we believe leads to the toxicity and inflammation that results in the chronic, degenerative problems many Westerners experience. (See the earlier discussion on the acid-alkaline balance in chapter 2.) Therefore, our program focuses on the alkaline-generating fruits and vegetables and the most alkaline grains, which include millet, quinoa, and buckwheat. We have avoided the use of commonly reactive foods, such as wheat and dairy products other than an occasional optional ingredient, as with the cheese in the Stuffed Bell Peppers (page 228).<br> We also suggest minimizing all chemical exposure, both from your environment and from your foods. Therefore, we support your inclusion of organic food choices whenever these are available, as well as avoiding packaged and processed foods as much as possible and minimizing chemical use at home.

Unknown in our day, Leavitt was no more recognized in her own: despite her enormous achievement, she was employed by the Harvard Observatory as a mere number-cruncher, at a wage not dissimilar from that of workers in the nearby textile mills. <em>Miss Leavitt&#x2019;s Stars</em> uncovers her neglected history.</p></p><p><strong>George Johnson</strong>, an award-winning science journalist, is the author of several books, most recently <em>The Cancer Chronicles</em> and <em>Strange Beauty</em>. He lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico.In the early 1900s the "computers" at the Harvard University Observatory were women, paid 25 cents an hour to pore over photographic plates taken with the university's telescope and to catalogue changes in the sizes and locations of stars. Henrietta Leavitt was an unmarried clergyman's daughter who began working at the observatory soon after graduating from Radcliffe. The director quickly recognized her skill and made generous allowances for the long absences occasioned by her apparently delicate health and family problems. <i>New York Times </i>science writer Johnson (<i>Strange Beauty</i>) relates that Leavitt's singular contribution to astronomy came when she recognized that cyclical changes in the size of Cepheids, giant variable stars, could be correlated with their luminosity. Once luminosity was known, a star's distance from Earth could be calculated. Leavitt wasn't interested in pushing her discovery to its logical conclusion, but other astronomers quickly grasped the ramifications for calculating the size of the Milky Way and the universe. In recent years, Leavitt has joined Rosalind Franklin in receiving long overdue recognition. Scant documentation exists for Leavitt's life aside from correspondence with the observatory, so readers shouldn't be surprised to discover that this excellent book is more about the search to measure the universe than about Leavitt's life. Nevertheless, it's a fine tribute to a remarkable woman of science. 10 illus. not seen by <i>PW</i>. <i>Agent, Esther Newberg.</i><i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It's the "a-ha" moment when one experiences the beauty and grace of life, whether it be when looking into the eyes of a newborn child or watching the sun set over the ocean. But those moments are usually too brief. Too often, people walk around in a fog, feeling vaguely frustrated, resigned, and cynical and asking all the wrong questions about how to make life better.&nbsp; They miss the purpose for being alive: to wake up and become oneself, to allow others to contribute to them and to, in turn, contribute their gifts to the world. This book gives readers specific methods for allowing luminosity into their lives on a consistent basis, allowing them to view the world with much younger, more vibrant eyes.</p><p>"Mastering Life's Energies offers the reader very bold and insightful instructions that can genuinely animate positive changes in a person's life. A wonderful book indeed." <br>-- Caroline Myss, author of Entering the Castle and Anatomy of the Spirit <p>"Marrying innovative strategies to pungent prose and hard-earned wisdom, this remarkable book provides a metaphysical kick in the pants. Both ironic and ecstatic, it gives us new skills we never thought to have and potent ways to release old habits so that we may truly live the luminous life we were always meant to have. Maria Nemeth has given us an evolutionary primer to new ways of being." <br>-- Jean Houston, PhD, author of A Mythic Life and A Passion for the Possible </p><p>"If you are willing to live a more luminous life, say yes to this book. Maria Nemeth provides practical ways to make a difference in your life right now." <br>-- Brenda Anderson, author of Playing the Quantum Field </p><p>"No fluff here. Just practical, sound advice to help you experience a greater sense of grace and ease in everyday life. It's like an ice cream sundae with a cherry on top: smooth and that much sweeter." <br>-- Jean Slatter, author of Hiring the Heavens </p><p>"For many years Maria Nemeth has been a beacon of clarity and wisdom in the area of manifestation. Her new book, Mastering Life's Energies, is a compassionate, wise and graceful addition to the remarkable body of work she has given us. If you seek inspiration for making your dreams a living reality, you will find a treasure-trove of insight and guidance in this book." <br>--Gay Hendricks, Ph.D. <br>Author of Conscious Living and (with Dr. Kathlyn Hendricks) Conscious Loving and Spirit-Centered Relationships </p><p>"Maria Nemeth has written another life altering book. Mastering Life's Energies helps us explore our own consciousness and willingness to live a life that works. Maria's writing is as practical as it is artful, as wise as it is informative, and allows one to truly see where they are and where they want to go. I highly recommend this book and all of Maria's work. She is a beacon of light at a time when confusion and indecision stop most of us from being everything we know we can be.

This figure shows up time and again in Native American folklore, where he takes many forms, from the irascible Coyote of the Southwest, to Iktomi, the amorphous spider man of the Lakota tribe. This dazzling collection of American Indian trickster tales, compiled by an eminent anthropologist and a master storyteller, serves as the perfect companion to their previous masterwork, American Indian Myths and Legends.<p><b>American Indian Trickster Tales</b> includes more than one hundred stories from sixty tribes--many recorded from living storytellers--which are illustrated with lively and evocative drawings. These entertaining tales can be read aloud and enjoyed by readers of any age, and will entrance folklorists, anthropologists, lovers of Native American literature, and fans of both Joseph Campbell and the Brothers Grimm.</p></p><p><b>Richard Erdoes</b> is an illustrator, photographer, and author of over twenty books on the American West, including the classics <b>Lame Deer</b> and <b>Lakota Woman</b>. He lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico.Erdoes, an illustrator and author, and Ortiz, a recently deceased Tewa Pueblo and distinguished professor of anthropology at the University of New Mexico, have compiled this anthology as a sequel to American Indian Myths and Legends (LJ 11/15/84). Some 106 tales, each identified with its tribe of origin, are divided into 14 parts arranged by theme. Additional information about the various tribes is provided in the appendix, which is arranged alphabetically. Many of the tales are reprinted from other sources and are thus not original. In addition, they are presented as if they were children's stories, so unfortunately the richness of Native American delivery is lost. Still, this is an extremely useful compilation for those libraries with a limited amount of Native American literature. The sexual nature of some of the stories and illustrations make this title inappropriate for school libraries. Recommended for public and academic libraries.?John Burch, Cumberland Coll.

Running away, the penguin visits place after place, searching for a chance to get his feet off the ground. But will flying be everything he had hoped?</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, December 2010</strong>: Oliver Jeffers has created an enchanting story of two friends, a boy and a penguin, whom we first met in Lost &amp; Found. In <i>Up &amp; Down</i>, the penguin dreams of flying--he has wings, after all--but nothing seems to be working until he spots an advertisement looking for a living cannonball. The penguin&#x2019;s excitement overtakes him and he sets off to fulfill his dream without telling the boy, only to realize later how much he misses his friend. Fortunately, the boy and the penguin are soon reunited, because it&#x2019;s all well and good to fly through the air alone, but the best part is having a friend to catch you on the way back down.

Iceberg Slim: Portrait of a Pimp shows Slim's transformation from pimp to the author of 7 classic books.<br><br>Mama Black Widow tells the tragic story of Otis Tilson, a stunning black drag queen trapped in a cruel queer ghetto underworld. In hopes of escaping the racial bigotry and economic injustice of the South, Otis&#x2019; family journeys north from their plantation to an urban promised land. Once in Chicago Otis and his brother and sisters become prisoners to a wasteland of violence, crime, prostitution and rape. This is the gut-wrenching tale of the destruction of a family and the truest portrayal of homosexuality in the ghetto ever told.</p><p>Iceberg Slim, aka Robert Beck, was born in Chicago in 1918 and initiated into the life of the pimp at age eighteen. He briefly attended the Tuskegee Institute but dropped out to return to the streets of the South Side, where he remained, pimping until he was forty-two. After several stints in jail, culminating in a ten month stay in Cook County, he decided to give up the life and turned to writing.

Lewis wrote to a friend, "When all is said (and truly said) about the divisions of Christendom, there remains, by God's mercy, an enormous common ground." From that time on, Lewis thought that the best service he could provide for his unbelieving neighbors was to explain and defend the faith that has been shared by nearly all Christians at all times.<br><br><i>Christian Reflections</i> contains fourteen of Lewis's papers defending Christianity. They are colorfully varied, covering such topics as Christianity and literature, ethics, futility, church music, the Psalms, and petitionary prayer. Common to them all, however, are the uniquely effective style of C. S. Lewis and the basic presuppositions of his theology -- his "mere" Christianity.</p><p>C. S. Lewis (1898-1963) taught English literature at both Oxford and Cambridge Universities and wrote more than thirty influential scholarly and popular books.

Until now, it has been very difficult for farmers, contractors, alternative energy aficionados, those concerned about Peak Oil, and small-scale entrepreneurs to obtain good, accurate information on producing alcohol, or on converting vehicles to run on alcohol fuel. And with all the conflicting news stories about ethanol, the public finds it difficult to sort fact from fiction. This text, which has been reviewed by scientists around the world, is the definitive reference work on alcohol fuel. <p> <i>Alcohol Can Be A Gas!</i> contains 640 8-1/2 by 11 pages, with 514 charts, photos, and illustrations to reinforce the information-dense text. The book is geared for the nonscientific reader, but its 473 endnotes provide the technical foundation behind the accessible prose. A 700-word glossary and a 6300-entry index extend the book's usefulness. </p><p> This book is the distilled essence of the most pertinent information ever assembled in one place on alcohol fuel, the technology that can help us finally become producers of almost limitless energy, instead of extractors of finite resources. How we produce our energy from here on out will determine how we govern ourselves and how we relate to nature and the environment; it will also create a sea change in where wealth concentrates. It will determine if the future is ruled by a small number of armed dictatorships backed by military and industrial interests (a cabal author David Blume likes to refer to as MegaOilron or the Oilygarchy), or if energy, and therefore power, is held by a diffusion of democratic entities, based on their ingenuity and ability to gather a portion of their daily solar income. </p><p> As Blume writes in the Introduction to <i>Alcohol Can Be a Gas!</i>: "Various prospective publishers argued that putting all of this material into one large volume might scare off readers who just want a recipe book of how to make alcohol. They said, 'All this history and politics is fascinating, but aren't you afraid that including it in your how-to book would scare away some buyers?' 'Put it in a separate publication,' their marketing experts said. But in the final analysis, I decided that this book should be a complete tool kit to revolutionize our transportation energy system, combining a broad, sweeping vision with intricate detail. </p><p> "I spent four years working on this book with a small team of researchers. I traveled all over the United States in search of the most up-to-date information. In frozen South Dakota, I talked to Orrie Swayze and his farmer and VFW buddies who are taking on the oil companies, and to alcohol combustion engineer and alcohol aviation expert, Jim Behnken. I went to Decatur, Illinois, to see the largest alcohol plant in the U.S., Archer Daniels Midland's 200-million-gallon-per-year plant. My travels also took me to Brazil to document the world's largest alcohol fuel program. </p><p> "It took over 25 years to finally get this book to you. It represents the confidence of almost 30 people who collectively loaned more than $250,000 to see this project through. It's the most comprehensive book ever written about alcohol fuel. Its production has been a massive effort that has depended on the cooperation of hundreds of people who contributed both their knowledge and, more importantly, their experiences."</p></p><p>This is a paperback so there's no flap but why waste a box. Here's some praise from others for the book.Praise for Alcohol Can Be A Gas! �"Brilliant! This book should be on the reading list of every American!!&#x201d; &#x2014;Thom Hartmann, New York Times best-selling author, and nationally syndicated host of The Thom Hartmann Program on Air America. &#x201c;Humanity has used up roughly half of the world&#x2019;s oil and topsoil. Just in time, David Blume has given us Alcohol Can Be A Gas! It&#x2019;s a practical road map for supplying all of our energy needs without drilling, strip-mining, and/or depleting the soil. In fact, following Blume&#x2019;s model, soil fertility would actually increase worldwide; energy production would be not only sustainable, but democratic&#x2014;and highly profitable on the small scale. This is a brilliant visionary work. And, with Mr. Blume&#x2019;s witty personality, reading it is certainly a gas.&#x201d; &#x2014;Larry Korn, Soil Scientist, Translator, and Editor of The One-Straw Revolution: An Introduction to Natural Farming."Dave Blume has written the definitive opus on alcohol as a fuel. From the 30,000-foot view to the most minute technical detail, Alcohol Can be a Gas! makes a strong case for the practical, ecological, political, and economic sense in converting to ethanol. It's heartening to see the world's original &#x201c;alcohol pioneer&#x201d; stay abreast of the times with a book that has the promise to knock some sense into our insidious fossil-fueled economy. This book is much needed in this era of Peak Oil and fast-accelerating climate change." &#x2014;John Schaeffer, President and Founder of Real Goods, and Executive Director of the Institute for Solar Living.As intersections of the food-energy-climate matrix form in Iowa cornfields, Amazonian rain forests and Canadian gene splicing labs, and end-game battles for their control pit theocratic flat-worlders against biologists, climatologists, and tree-huggers over the very survival of life on Earth, David Blume emerges like a wizard on a misty pinnacle, back-lit by the full moon, revealing a gemstone in his extended palm.Albert Bates, author, The Post Petroleum Survival Guide and Cookbook: Recipes for Changing Times (New Society, 2006) The over-arching importance of this delightful book is that it demonstrates how beside the point is the current pseudo-debate about the net energy from corn ethanol. As Blume demonstrates, fuel alcohol must be an important component of our solar-based future. It can be made from a huge variety of feedstocks, including sugar beets and cane, nuts, mesquite, Jerusalem artichokes, algae, even coffee-bean pulp; there is no real scarcity of land to grow fuel. There is a scarcity of independent, original thinking--and Blume&#x2019;s book provides plenty of it, along with ample doses of amazing, startling, and sometimes scary information--ecological, technological, and political-economic. This is a vast, detailed compendium drawn from decades of experience by an alert, smart, and skeptical hands-on thinker. Blume has given us his biofuels bible, and we can learn from him and survive quite nicely, or follow what he calls MegaOilron into oblivion.&#x2014;Ernest Callenbach, author of Ecotopia, Ecotopia Emerging, and Ecology:A Pocket Guide What a tour-de-force! This is the most comprehensive and authoritative guide through all the controversy about ethanol as transportation fuel, showing it as a clear winner in the quest for solutions to our environmental and geopolitical problems. Engagingly written, full of important and amazing information and resources, this book meets every challenge to the vision for a clean, democratic path to a prosperous future for all.-Joe Jordan, Atmospheric Researcher, NASA/Ames Research Center Finally an alcohol book for the layman and backyard enthusiast. In our culture's collective industrialized love affair with mega everything, Blume cuts across the government-subsidized factories with ecologically practical models. Here is a viable energy system that can be embedded in a region linking rural producers to urban users of energy and food. Self-reliance and resiliency follow community-based alcohol production, and we all owe a debt of gratitude to Blume for codifying his life's passion in what is a veritable compendium of information. Joel Salatin Farmer and author of bothYou Can Farm and Everything I Want to Do Is Illegal.Ethanol champion David Blume has completed his opus, Alcohol Can Be a Gas! It is a great read. The history of petroleum, history of alcohol, technical coverage of production process, vehicle development (conversion) and feedstocks. It's all in the text complete with charts and pictures.David's wit, wisdom and hardcore experience illuminate this biofuels potential. We have eagerly awaited this publication and will use it in Sustainable Transportation and Biofuels courses.Dr. Jack Martin, Appropriate Technology Program, Appalachian State University, Vice-Chair of Renewable Fuels and Transportation Division, American Solar Energy Society|Dear Reader, Thanks so much for purchasing this special limited first edition printing of Alcohol Can Be A Gas! For many of you, I want to especially thank you for your patience. I have been working full-time on this project for four years, and that&#x2019;s two years longer than I thought it would take. For those of you who have hung in there with me, and kept cheering me on when the going was tough, I have to say I couldn&#x2019;t have done it without your support. When I first started on this project 25 years ago&#x2014;filmed my series for KQED and wrote the original book&#x2014;I thought it had the potential to make a substantial difference to the economics and environmental quality of the United States.But today I have set a much higher bar for the goals for this book. I believe that the human race&#x2019;s ability to survive&#x2014;in the face of the interconnected problems of Peak Oil, climate change that&#x2019;s heading for the tipping point, and unchecked population growth&#x2014;is in question. Without a radical change in how we power our societies and conduct our agriculture, the civilization we currently take for granted will dissolve due to wars for resources, while a large part of humanity will be forced to migrate to higher ground. It is my expectation that this new book will be a tool for the revolutionary change needed to address the challenges facing the entire planet, not just the U.S. So someday, when there are alcohol biorefineries producing fuel, food, and all sorts of products in every bioregion, when greenhouse gases are on the decline and ice packs are deepening on the poles, when air pollution is a thing of the past, all of our sewage is processed in cattail marshes, kelp farms send spent mash through derelict oil pipelines to Midwest farms, agriculture becomes otherwise regionalized and organic, you will be able to pat yourself on the back and know you helped make it happen.Share. Organize. Win.Dave Blume 6/11/07David Blume started his ecological training young. He and his father Jerry grew almost all the food their family ate, organically on a city lot in San Francisco in the mid-'60s!<p> Dave taught his first ecology class in 1970. After majoring in Ecological Biology and Biosystematics at San Francisco State University, he worked on experimental projects, first for NASA, and then as a member of the <i>Mother Earth News</i> Eco Village alternative building and alternative energy teams. </p><p> When the energy crisis of 1978-79 struck, Dave started the American Homegrown Fuel Co., an educational organization that taught upwards of 7000 people how to produce and use low-cost alcohol fuel at home or on the farm. </p><p> KQED, San Francisco s Public Broadcasting System station, asked Dave to put his alcohol workshop on television, and together they spent two years making the ten-part series, <i>Alcohol as Fuel.</i> To accompany the series, Dave wrote the comprehensive manual on the subject, the original <i>Alcohol Can Be A Gas!</i> Shortly after the first show aired, in 1983, oil companies threatened to pull out their funding of KQED if the series was continued. KQED halted the distribution of the series and book (see this current book's Introduction for the whole story). </p><p> In 1984, Dave founded Planetary Movers, an award-winning social experiment and commercial venture, well known for productive activism (e.g., on behalf of Nicaragua's Sandinistas), as well as for pioneering practices of progressive employment, green marketing, and the sharing of a percentage of profits for peace and the environment. </p><p> In 1994, he started Our Farm. This community-supported agriculture (CSA) farm was also a teaching farm, based on sustainable practices, that hosted over 200 interns and apprentices from all over the world, and held regular tours for thousands of people. Our Farm grew as much as 100,000 pounds of food per acre, without a tractor, using only hand tools, on a terraced, 35-degree slope. </p><p> The International Institute for Ecological Agriculture (IIEA), founded by Dave in 1993, is dedicated to healing the planet while providing for the human community with research, education, and the implementation of socially just, ecologically sound, resource-conserving forms of agriculture the basis of all sustainable societies. </p><p> Dave has consulted for a wide array of clients, including governments, farmers, and companies interested in turning waste into valuable and profitable products. Recent work includes a feasibility study for a macadamia growers' cooperative in Mexico, and a water harvesting/reforestation project in Antigua, West Indies. He is working with a farming college connected to the government of Ghana to develop alternative fuels, to train agricultural extension agents in organic farming, and to design an ecological strategy to stop the Sahara Desert from advancing. He also recently inspired the city of Urbana, Illinois, to hold a conference between builders, lenders, developers, municipalities, building inspectors, architects, and engineers, to coordinate the mainstreaming of natural building technologies. </p><p> "Farmer Dave" is often called upon to testify before agencies on issues related to the land and democracy. He is a frequent speaker at ecological, sustainability, Peak Oil, and agricultural conferences in the Americas, and has appeared in interviews over 1000 times in print, radio, and television. Dave firmly believes in Emma Goldman's view of, "If I can't dance, I don't want to be in your revolution," and he can frequently be found on the dance floor when he isn't flagrantly inciting democracy.</p></p><h2>The Chronological Life of Christ</h2><p>Mark Moore has written a commentary utilizing examples that give a clear understanding as to how each text fits into today&#39;s world.

It is the love and cooking talent that Korean mothers and grandmothers mix into their handmade foods. For Chef Roy Choi, food means love.

Connor draws on the concepts of Langstroth, Doolittle, Brother Adam, Mike Palmer and more while integrating his unique academic and commercial beekeeping experiences into this concise and thought-provoking second edition. Adding more methods of making increase colonies and recent developments in the science of bee biology, the second edition expands on its predecessor with rich, colorful photography and diagrams. In less than a decade, the beekeeping industry has made a wide-spread shift to increase nuclei colonies as a means of producing new colonies in the face of heavy losses from poor nutrition, pesticides, virus-mite interactions and general climate change.</p><p>Michigan native Lawrence (Larry) Connor departed Michigan State University upon completion of his Ph.D. dissertation on strawberry pollination when he assumed the position of extension apicultural entomologist at The Ohio State University (Columbus).

She lives in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.PreSchool-Grade 1-- Stylized fish shapes in flat, razzle-dazzle colors against a dark blue background float across the pages from one to ten, accompanied by one little dark fish who keeps the count going. Cutout circles at the eyes reveal colors on succeeding pages. The slight text, occasionally in rhyme, introduces adjectives through the count, and tries to set a context of wish-fulfillment. It's a slick production, attempting several concepts at once--numbers, shapes, colors, imagining, addition to a value of one--but it doesn't quite hang together, and its result is a little breathless. MacDonald and Oakes' Numblers (Dial, 1988) also uses strong color and stark form to present visually the concepts of increasing quantity and transformations, but in a more thoughtful and well-integrated way, with movement inherent in the design. Another little dark fish, Lionni's Swimmy (Pantheon, 1963), has a more meaningful underwater exploration, incorporating the idea of changing appearances into the story. --Karen Litton, London Public Libraries, Ontario, Canada<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Letters to Penthouse XII: It Just Gets Hotter (Penthouse Adventures, 12)</h2><p>In these uninhibited letters to Penthouse magazine, the writers reveal everything that goes on behind closed doors, as well as in back and front seats of cars, locked offices, airplane toilets and other places.</p><p></p><h2>Hound of Heaven, The: And other poems</h2><p>Francis Thompson is considered the greatest modern Catholic poet, and the Hound of Heaven his greatest inspiration writing; but readers of all faiths find it a spiritual beauty and lyric quality of universal appeal.

Since 1900, global sea levels have risen steadily each year to a global average of about 8 inches (20cm) today, and they're still rising. By 2100, the sea could climb as much as 14 feet (4.3m) to 32 feet (9.75m). </p><p> <i>Rising Seas: Flooding, Climate Change and Our New World</i> gives youth an eye-popping view of what the Earth might look like under the rising and falling water levels of climate change. Photographs juxtapose the present-day with that same area's projected future. The shocking images will help them understand the urgency for action. Key issues in today's news will be better understood, such as the 2015 Paris Protocol in which the world agreed to limit temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius (ideally 1.5 degree). </p></p><p><p> Keltie Thomas is the author of <i>Do Fish Fart?</i> and <i>How Hockey Works</i>, as well as many other highly acclaimed children's books nominated for several awards.

(<i>Sal's Fiction Addiction</i> 2018-03-22)<br><br>Discussions of climate change are often nonspecific and abstract. This accessible call to action focuses on particular regions of the world that have been or may be impacted by rising sea levels. Thomas begins with a straightforward explanation of why sea levels are rising, describing the impact of carbon emissions in the atmosphere leading to warming water, which expands. Melting glaciers and ice sheets are also culprits in the rise of sea levels, she explains. Digitally rendered photo illustrations depict hypothetical flooding--the Statue of Liberty appears waist-deep in seawater; the Gateway to India monument is flooded from Mumbai Harbor; and a future Miami Beach is inundated. The eye-catching images may come across as dramatized worst-case-scenarios, yet the photographs of areas that are already facing damaging floods underscore the true potential for destruction. End pages offer 10 steps readers can take to help combat global warming, including reducing water usage, eating less<br> meat, and recycling.

Most tweens, however, already know that swift, strong climate action is required of them--and this book's back matter suggests 10 ways to make a difference. (Lela Nargi <i>Sierra Club</i> 2018-08-27)<br><br>The first few pages of this book describe the impact that water has on shaping our planet (rivers, streams, glaciers, oceans, etc.). It also explains the reasons for the gradual rise in ocean levels and identifies some of the coastal communities that are most at risk for flooding. The author then highlights 15 geographic locations (Miami Beach, Nova Scotia, Mumbai, etc.) and illustrates how the populations there will be impacted by the continued rising of sea water levels. The book concludes with examples of actions that students and their families can take to reduce carbon emissions. Illustrated with photographs and cartoon style drawings, this book presents information in a clear and concise manner.

Bliss paints an engaging portrait of a man of ambition, boundless, driving energy, a fanatical work ethic, a penchant for self-promotion and ruthlessness, more than a touch of egotism and meanness, and an enormous appetite for life. Equally important, Bliss traces the rise of American surgery as seen through the eyes of one of its pioneers. The book describes how Cushing, working in the early years of the 20th century, developed remarkable new techniques that let surgeons open the skull, expose the brain, and attack tumors--all with a much higher rate of success than previously known. Indeed, Cushing made the miraculous in surgery an everyday event, as he and his team compiled an astonishing record of treating more than two thousand tumors.<br> This is the definite Cushing biography, an epic narrative of high surgical adventure, capturing the highs and lows of an extraordinary life.<br></p><p><p>'A fast paced, engaging portrait of one of America's great pioneers and heroes. Michael Bliss gives important insight into Cushing's motivations, inspirations, demons, and flaws, thus revealing how he was motivated to change a field and bravely create a new outlook on the functioning of the brain as well as a fundamentally new approach to medicine and research.'</p>-Henry Brem, Harvey Cushing Professor and Chairman, Department of Neurosurgery, Johns Hopkins Hospital and School of Medicine<br><strong>Michael Bliss</strong> holds the prestigious rank of University Professor at the University of Toronto.

Like Alyssa Satin Capucilli's The Potty Book for Boys and The Potty Book for Girls (both Barron's, 2000), their texts are identical, except for the gender references. "Michael is a boy just your age." "Ashley is a girl just your age." However, the direct, engaging language and questions aimed at young listeners make these titles far superior to Capucilli's singsong offerings. In both of Cole's titles, the parents buy a potty, encourage their child to use it, and eventually success is achieved. While the watercolor illustrations are not identical in the two books, they are very similar and add a cheerful, perky touch, portraying a boy/girl well into the toddler stage, surrounded by loving, smiling parents (no stress here). Cole's Your New Potty (Morrow, 1989) traces the progress of both a girl and boy, with alternating looks at each child, using photographs that, like Fred Rogers's Going to the Potty (PaperStar, 1997), give young listeners a look at other "real" children learning this momentous skill. Both Cole's older book and the newer pair include useful, clearly stated tips for parents.<br><i>Jane Marino, Scarsdale Public Library, NY </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Life in the Combat Zone: How to Survive, Thrive, &amp; Overcome in the Midst of Difficult Situations</h2><p>In&nbsp;Life in the Combat Zone,&nbsp;Rick Renner&nbsp;teaches you what it takes to fight effectively and come out with the victory, no matter what type of spiritual conflict you face.<br> Throughout the book, Rick reveals the traits needed to emerge as a conqueror from every spiritual conflict.

Born about 1797 in Northhampton County, North Carolina, he was a slave for most of his life, until Emancipation in 1865. Horton, who taught himself to read, found his way into the hearts of many unwitting belles of North Carolina through his selling of personalized love lyrics to students at nearby Chapel Hill. He furthered his education by borrowing what books he could from these students. <br><br>Many of Horton's best poems concern the topic of slavery. His "On Hearing of the Intention of a Gentleman to Purchase the Poet's Freedom," "On Liberty and Slavery," and "The Slave's Complaint" examine the slave's position in clean and learned verses. "George Moses Horton, Myself" captures in its paced, cool contemplativeness and terse lyrics some of the unresolved strivings of the poet. <br><br>Horton had hoped to purchase his freedom with the sales of his first book of poems, <i>The Hope of Liberty</i> (published in Raleigh in 1829), the first full volume of verse published by an African American since Phillis Wheatley's some thirty years before. But he fell short of this goal, living instead through three generations of Horton ownership. <br><br><i>The Hope of Liberty</i> was reissued in 1837 in Philadelphia under the title <i>Poems by a Slave</i>. Horton's second volume, <i>Naked Genius,</i> came to print in 1865, the year in which he escaped to the Northern infantry then occupying Raleigh. Little was heard of Horton after this point, and it is generally assumed that he lived the remainder of his life in Philadelphia, where he died in about 1883.<br><b>Frances E. W. Harper</b> (1825-1911), author of "Learning to Read" <br><br>Frances Ellen Watkins Harper was born free in Baltimore in 1825. By the time of her death in 1911, she had become almost an institution in both literary and political circles. Harper used what seems to have been a tireless energy to publish countless poems, articles, essays, and novels examining both racial and gender division among Americans. Often thought of as the inaugural "protest poet," she presented her themes in graceful rhetoric, skillful metaphor, allusion, and allegory, embracing the demands of her craft along with the exigencies of the social moment. <br><br>Harper worked ably and extensively in her lifetime with the Underground Railroad, the Maine Anti-Slavery Society, the Women's Christian Temperance movement, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the American Equal Rights Association, the Universal Peace Union, the National Council of Women, and the National Association of Colored Women. Her <i>Poems on Miscellaneous Subjects</i> was published in 1854, with a preface by William Lloyd Garrison. This volume proved so popular that it went through over twenty reprints in the author's lifetime. <br><br>Harper was also the author of <i>Moses: A Story of the Nile,</i> published in 1869, <i>Poems</i> in 1871, and <i>Sketches of Southern Life</i> in 1873. <i>Iola Leroy,</i> one of the more widely read novels written by an African American of the nineteenth century, was published in 1893.</p><h2>Madness Under the Royal Palms</h2><p><b>The <i>New York Times</i> bestselling history of the glamour and debauchery of the ultra-wealthy Palm Beach community--from The Breakers to Trump's Mar-a-Lago.</b><br>For more than a hundred years, Palm Beach has been an exclusive and exotic universe of wealth and privilege in America.

He escapes, barely, but finds himself on the run and hunted as Queen Jezebel attempts to stamp out the worship of the Hebrew God in Israel and replace it with the worship of Ba&#x2019;al.As the queen&#x2019;s soldiers close in on him, Elijah discovers a little known promise in the Scroll of Deuteronomy and prays for something impossible &#x2013; that God would turn the skies to bronze and stop the rain on the kingdom that has abandoned Him. And God says yes. As drought and famine grip the cloudless land of Israel, God tells Elijah to hide and sends him to the land of Tyre, to a widow and her son who are on the edge of starvation. In Tyre Elijah finds a darkness at the heart of the city, a darkness that threatens to consume Israel next. But even if he survives, will Israel listen to his warning?<i>This is a re-imagining of the story of Elijah from the Bible.</i></p><p>Excerpt - Reprinted by permission all rights reserved&nbsp; &nbsp;Elijah watched as the Sons of Ba'al stalked in a slow circle around their altar, knives dripping red with their own blood as a haunting chant rose towards the sky. He stared for a moment at the blaze of opulent scarlet robes. There were so many... and not all were Sidonian. That fact stung worst of all.&nbsp; &nbsp;Across the brown grass no more than twenty cubits away sat the crowd... no, not really a crowd, a multitude. People from all of Israel who'd come to Mount Carmel to ask a simple question.&nbsp; &nbsp;Who was God?&nbsp; &nbsp;The harsh wails of the priests reached a crescendo off to his left, and the crowd shrank back a step. A little boy in the front clutched his father's leg, a flicker of fear on his face. Elijah sighed and shook his head; he wanted to shout at them that there was nothing to fear, no more danger in the screams than the cawing of crows. But the truth was, outnumbered 450 to one - two if he counted God - there was still a part of him that was a little scared too.&nbsp; &nbsp;What if this didn't work?&nbsp; &nbsp;Four Years EarlierSamaria&nbsp; &nbsp;Jezebel strolled through the palace with smooth, measured steps, her skirts swishing in constant time like the beating of a timbrel. Outside she duplicated perfectly the dignified paces her mother had taught her back home. Inside though, she was a seething cauldron of anger.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Israelite servants all slid to the side as she passed, their backs pressed against the walls and eyes towards the floor. Apparently news traveled fast. The only ones without fear in their eyes were members of her own retinue. Up ahead High Priest Baltazar rounded the corner.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"My Queen," he gave a curt bow, "we have him."&nbsp; &nbsp;"Where?"&nbsp; &nbsp;"This way." He led off through the maze of hallways that Jezebel had long since gotten to know like the back of her hand. It was two left turns until they arrived at a small side room. This close to the servants quarters the door mantles weren't inlaid with ivory; instead they were just white plastered stone. Unlike the boundless wealth she'd grown accustomed to as a young girl, her husband's profligacy did have limits.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Two members of the royal guard stood at the door, spears held at a slight angle. They instantly stiffened when they saw her, their backs becoming just a little straighter, oval shields gripped a bit tighter.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pushing through the door, she followed Baltazar into a cramped, torch-lit room where several more of his priests and an older woman all surrounded the beaten and bloodied figure of a man bound to a chair. Jezebel's eyes narrowed when she saw him, her lips twisting in anger. "Where did you find him?"&nbsp; &nbsp;"The lower city, near the south gate." The older woman, Sisi, stepped forward. "Birkana was headed to Bethel with several of the priestesses when they found him spouting off his lies to a crowd there. She came back, and Baltazar led the guard down to take him."&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jezebel nodded and stared at the man a moment. Even before he'd been attacked, he'd been dressed little better than a common peasant. Now his tunic was smudged with dirt and red streaks of his own blood. When she leaned close, her nose wrinkled at the sweaty, trash heap smell of someone who'd been on the road for far too long and didn't have the sense to use perfume.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She glanced at Sisi. "I assume he just arrived today, do you know where he...?"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You..." the man's eyes finally cracked open, his voice weak.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jezebel's gaze lanced in at him like daggers. "Yes, me," she snapped, "and show a bit more respect when addressing your Queen."&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The man took a halting breath before whispering, "Not... my... Queen."&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Instantly Baltazar stepped close and slugged him hard across the cheek, knocking a tooth loose. Jezebel regarded it in disgust. "Right," she sneered, "I forgot, your 'God' still doesn't like my husband and me. Or is it a different song and dance this time? Has He changed his mind?"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Somehow the contempt brought a spark of defiance to the man's eyes. He spit blood at her feet. "You worship lies," he managed.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Baltazar pulled back his fist to teach the man a second lesson, but Jezebel raised a hand to stop him. "You really think that?" she taunted. "That Ba'al is a lie?"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The man's face hardened, "There is only one God and-"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His voice cut off as Baltazar stepped forward and pounded him again.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jezebel shook her head. "And where is He?" she leaned in close. "I know where Ba'al and Asherah are, I sacrificed to them last week. What about this 'God' you love so much? If He's so glorious, where are his priests? Why are his altars forgotten while the altar to Ba'al is stained red with sacrifices?"The man coughed and winced at the pain, his breaths heavy. He didn't reply though.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jezebel's scowl darkened at his stubborn obstinacy. "Answer me," she hissed. "If your God is so powerful, where is He?"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"He doesn't need you..." the old man finally spoke, "or me... He is."&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Right," she rolled her eyes, "whatever that means." She was about to tell Baltazar to get rid of the old fool when the door creaked open behind him.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Jezebel, I heard-" Her husband's voice abruptly cut off when he saw what waited inside. "I guess you already know."&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The various priests in the room bowed as King Ahab stepped in and Jezebel dipped in a polite curtsey. "You're just in time, husband," she flashed him a smile. "My new friend here was explaining something about his God." She punctuated her statement with a sharp kick to the man's leg that elicited a low groan.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ahab's mouth tightened in frustration. "And what was it this time?" he asked.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The old man managed a faint answer. "The Lord..." he coughed, and blood trickled from his mouth, "The Lord will judge Israel for her sins," he said. "Your sins, and..." he paused, an ember of fear in his eyes as they drifted to Jezebel, "and hers."&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The queen's face twisted in rage. No one talked to her like that, least of all this ignorant peasant. She was Jezebel of Tyre, Daughter of Ithobaal, Queen of Israel, Priestess of Asherah, and High Matron of Samaria. Before Ahab could react, she whipped out the dagger she carried at her side and slammed it into his chest.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The man shuddered and gasped, a red stain spreading across his chest. She leaned close to his ear, her lips curling in a mocking taunt as she whispered, "If your 'God' is so great, then maybe He can save you... or not."&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The old man was dying, but he summoned up one last sentence. "The Lord... is not... mocked."&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His head slid forward, and the man slumped in the chair as he breathed his last, leaving her with nothing but a lifeless corpse to vent her fury on.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Fool," she wrenched loose her ivory handled blade and handed it off to Sisi to be cleaned.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Dearest," she felt Ahab's hand on her shoulder, "maybe that wasn't the wisest..."&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't tell me what's wise," she fumed, the anger still coursing like hot fire in her veins.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For a moment her husband said nothing, but finally she felt his fingers clasp at hers. "Let's go to the garden," the king offered. "Talk somewhere that isn't here."&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Pheromone: The Insect Artwork of Christopher Marley</h2><p>This book presents the compositions of Christopher Marley: assemblages of real insect bodies that display brilliant color and otherworldly form.

Winds whipped my horse&#x2019;s mane and made my poncho hood flap.<br> <br>But I still heard breaths.<br> <br>The tiny hairs on my nape rose. My mare snorted, her ears pricked forward. I didn&#x2019;t have Lark&#x2019;s animal keenness or the senses of a huntress like Selena, but I could feel someone&#x2014;or something&#x2014;watching me.<br> <br>Stalking me?<br> <br>Inhale exhale<br> <br>I rode harder, pushing myself, pushing my staggering horse, forcing her to navigate the rocky terrain faster than was safe.<br> <br>I hadn&#x2019;t slept since fleeing Death&#x2019;s lair days ago&#x2014;if you could call them &#x201c;days&#x201d; in this never-ending darkness.

Even now, I couldn&#x2019;t believe what I&#x2019;d done to escape Aric.<br> <br>Every other minute, a raindrop would hit one of my eyes directly, the sting blurring my vision. I would blink to clear my eyes, and details of my last encounter with Death would blossom in my mind. . . .<br> <br>The feel of his sword-roughened palms as he&#x2019;d seized my waist and laid me in his bed. His rasped words: &#x201c;If you surrender to me, you will be mine alone. My wife in truth. I will do anything to have that.&#x201d; Even coercing me, promising to save Jack&#x2014;for a price.<br> <br>Blink.<br> <br>His scent&#x2014;sandalwood, pine, masculine&#x2014;had weakened my will like a drug, quelling the heat of battle inside me. Still I&#x2019;d managed to say: &#x201c;This won&#x2019;t work out as you plan.&#x201d;<br> <br>Blink.<br> <br>His head had inched closer, his amber eyes intent, just before his lips had covered mine. His kiss had a way of muddling my thoughts, making me forget all the things I needed to remember.<br> <br>Blink.<br> <br>&#x201c;There. That&#x2019;s better,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d murmured as he&#x2019;d removed my clothes. &#x201c;Just let me see you . . . touch you.&#x201d; With his supernatural strength, he must have taken pains not to rip the lace of my panties.<br> <br>When I lay naked before him, his amber eyes had glittered like stars. Pinpoints of light had mesmerized me. &#x201c;So lovely, sieva. My gods, you humble me.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d given me one of his rare unguarded smiles. &#x201c;This is joy I feel, is it not?&#x201d; I&#x2019;d wanted to sob.<br> <br>Blink. Blink. Blink.<br> <br>I shook my head hard. I needed to pay attention. I couldn&#x2019;t afford to get lost in memories. To get lost at all.<br> <br>When I&#x2019;d readied a bug-out bag and my gear in a panic, Matthew had telepathically directed me: &#x2014;Follow the rushing water upstream into slaver territory. Find the soot valley, then travel its length. If you reach the mass gravesite, you&#x2019;ve gone too far. Ascend the next mountain to the stone forest.&#x2014;<br> <br>Yet since then, he hadn&#x2019;t answered any of my calls.<br> <br>I reached the end of a soot-filled valley and started the climb. Rain began to pour.<br> <br>Minutes? hours? days? passed. Despite the threat I&#x2019;d sensed, I could barely stay awake. My head kept dipping. Maybe I could close my eyes&#x2014;just for a second. I dropped forward, resting my cheek against the horse&#x2019;s mane, an arm on either side of her neck.<br> <br>My lids slid shut.<br> <br><br> <br>When I opened them, I was at Haven.<br> <br>The mare was gone. No rain, no winds. The sky was star-strewn black. All around me, that eerie A.F. silence.<br> <br>Matthew, am I in one of your visions? Every detail felt so real. Bitter ash tinged my tongue. The scent of scorched oaks and sugarcane stung my nose. In the distance, Haven House was a blackened ruin. My mother&#x2019;s funeral pyre.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d burned her body and our home.<br> <br>Jack had secretly helped her die. I understood why. I didn&#x2019;t accept how. I couldn&#x2019;t reconcile after.<br> <br>How many lies he&#x2019;d told.<br> <br>Grief ripped through me, for my mother, for our life before the Flash. My new existence was so brutal and visceral, I wondered if my pre-apocalypse memories were actually a soft and hazy dream.<br> <br>What was real? Unreal?<br> <br>Though Matthew had looked away when my mom had died, he could still access scenes from the past. Was he giving me the memory of her death?<br> <br>A breeze feathered over the ash on the ground, the sound beautiful&#x2014;like sighing. I heard my mother&#x2019;s faint voice telling Jack, &#x201c;Use the pillow. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>No, Matthew! I&#x2019;m not ready to see this! Not ready&#x2014;<br> <br>A wolf&#x2019;s howl pierced the night.<br> <br><br> <br>I jolted awake in the saddle. The rain had dwindled to a foggy drizzle. How long had I been out?<br> <br>I rubbed my gritty eyes. Almost screamed. I was surrounded by shadowy figures.<br> <br>Wait, not figures. All around me were towering stacks of rocks, placed like logs for a bonfire. There were so many stacks the area resembled a forest. The stone forest.<br> <br>Who would waste calories to assemble these? And why did I find them so chilling?<br> <br>Matthew, are you there?<br> <br>At last, I felt his presence in my mind! &#x2014;Empress!&#x2014;<br> <br>Has Violet joined her brother yet?<br> <br>&#x2014;The Violet is not there.&#x2014;<br> <br>Oh, thank God.<br> <br>&#x2014;Soon.&#x2014;<br> <br>Shit! You told me Vincent camped within days of Death&#x2019;s castle. I&#x2019;ve ridden for DAYS.<br> <br>&#x2014;Arcana all around.&#x2014;<br> <br>I heard their calls, as if from a sound-out. . . .<br> <br>&#x2014;Eyes to the skies, lads!&#x2014; Joules.<br> <br>&#x2014;Trapped in the palm of my hand.&#x2014; Tess.<br> <br>&#x2014;I watch you like a hawk.&#x2014; Gabriel.<br> <br>&#x2014;Behold the Bringer of Doubt!&#x2014; Selena.<br> <br>&#x2014;Don&#x2019;t look at this hand, look at that one.&#x2014; Finn.<br> <br>&#x2014;Crazy like a fox.&#x2014; Matthew.<br> <br>&#x2014;We will love you. In our own way.&#x2014; The Lovers.<br> <br>So many Arcana were close. Which meant I was close.<br> <br>&#x2014;Terror from the abyss!&#x2014; Huh?<br> <br>Before I could ask about the new call, my sense of being watched returned. I jerked my head around.<br> <br>&#x2014;Empress, you&#x2019;re one stone forest and one clearing away. Some . . . obstacles between us.&#x2014;<br> <br>Movement. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a man skulking from one stack of rocks to the next.<br> <br>Another man loped to join the first. The armed pair wore fatigues and creepy night-vision goggles. Soldiers of the Lovers&#x2019; army?<br> <br>The stones were for cover, staged as if for a paint-ball course! How long had those men been lying here in wait?<br> <br>Matthew, I&#x2019;m in trouble! I slapped the reins against the mare. She whinnied a protest, but increased her speed. Chest heaving, she wound around the stacks.<br> <br>I craned my head back. Two soldiers had become ten, all with rifles at the ready. Now they walked in plain view. Because I was already surrounded?<br> <br>As the ground began to flatten, those stacks grew fewer. I raised my hand above my eyes, straining to see. Ahead&#x2014;the clearing Matthew had spoken of!<br> <br>My face fell. With no vegetation, it was a quagmire, water and muck pooling in huge craters.<br> <br>Past that, a wall towered, must be thirty feet high. What lay behind it?<br> <br>A shot rang out; a bullet whizzed by my head. My mount fled from the sound. &#x201c;Go, GO!&#x201d;<br> <br>In my panic, my nails morphed into thorn claws. The razor-sharp edges sliced through the fingers of my gloves. My glyphs stirred, moving over my skin.<br> <br>A second gunshot. The near-miss bullet pitted the mud beside the horse&#x2019;s hooves. She shrieked, trotting faster.<br> <br>The shooters missed on purpose. They would want me&#x2014;and the horse&#x2014;alive.<br> <br>Women and horses were two valuable A.F. commodities.<br> <br>Desperate for safety, I squinted at the wall. Men guarded a brightly lit gate.<br> <br>&#x2014;Head there, Empress.&#x2014;<br> <br>My mare would have to slog through the clearing. It was like a moat fronting that wall. The soldiers would catch me long before then.<br> <br>A bright color drew my attention. Attached to a post was a handcrafted sign emblazoned with a red skull and crossbones&#x2014;along with the warning: DANGER! MINES!<br> <br>And that explained the craters.<br> <br>Are you kidding, Matthew? Soldiers trailing me; mines ahead. How do I get past a minefield?<br> <br>An agonized yell sounded behind me.<br> <br>I dared a glance back. Only nine soldiers followed. They ran toward me at a faster clip. The ones at the edges aimed their guns&#x2014;off to their sides.<br> <br>Another horrified yell.<br> <br>And another.<br> <br>Open gunfire erupted. Muzzle flashes warred with fog; I couldn&#x2019;t make out anything.<br> <br>I turned forward. Screamed.<br> <br>Three soldiers stood before me, rifles trained on my face. The mare reared, punching hooves at them.<br> <br>The other gunmen had been pushing me toward these!<br> <br>Yet behind them, a black beast melded with shadow. One brilliant golden eye gleamed like a lantern.<br> <br>Cyclops! Had Lark sent her one-eyed wolf to protect me?<br> <br>Baring dagger-size fangs, the massive beast gave a spine-chilling snarl. The men twisted around&#x2014;<br> <br>Cyclops launched himself at the panic-stricken soldiers, knocking them to the ground. His mighty jaws clamped down on limbs and rifles, snapping through bone and metal.<br> <br>Body parts sailed into the air. Blood spurted like a mall fountain. I winced, though I should be used to seeing stuff like this.<br> <br>The wolf lifted his head from the carnage and growled at the stupefied soldiers positioned behind me. Those bastards had driven me into a trap; Cyclops ate the trap.<br> <br>Faced with the beast&#x2019;s dripping maw, they fled headlong.<br> <br>For me, Cyclops wagged his scarred tail. &#x201c;Good damn wolf. Good boy.&#x201d;<br> <br>Matthew said: &#x2014;Ride for the fort! You have to make it to the wall.&#x2014;<br> <br>What&#x2019;s behind the wall? For all I knew, Matthew was sending me into the Milovn�cis&#x2019; camp.<br> <br>&#x2014;RIDE!&#x2014;<br> <br>Into mines? We&#x2019;re going to get blown away! Forget my self-healing powers; I couldn&#x2019;t regenerate from decapitation.<br> <br>&#x2014;Go left.&#x2014;<br> <br>Directing me around the danger?<br> <br>I turned to Cyclops. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if you can understand me, or if Lark is steering her familiar. But follow my mount carefully unless you want to regrow limbs.&#x201d; He was still limping from our battle with the Devil Card.<br> <br>He chuffed, and bubbles of blood formed over his snout. With a swish of his tail, he defiantly snapped up a dismembered arm, carrying it like a chew toy. But he did move behind me.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m trusting you, Matthew.

His first published piece was in the Comic Reader #183, a spot illustration of Red Sonja (pg. 9). His first published front cover was the Comic Reader #196; Dominic Fortune, the Spirit, and Doc Savage in November of 1981. Mike Mignola began inking in August of 1983 for Marvel Comics. He inked issues of comic books such as Daredevil (#197 'Introducing' him), Power Man &amp; Iron Fist. Mignola is particularly noted for his highly distinctive style, which was once called "German expressionism meets Jack Kirby" by Alan Moore, in an introduction to a collection of Mignola's Hellboy works. While Mignola has heavily influenced a new generation of comics artists since he began working on Hellboy, he was something of an odd man out in the superhero comics industry in the beginning of his career. Mignola's imagery stood in stark contrast to the style of his contemporaries. Where others would draw muscular men and slim, well-endowed women, Mignola's characters were usually bulky and rough-looking, and more often than not defined by large shadowed areas rather than fine details. Mignola often takes the same approach to architecture, particularly in Hellboy, where he often sets the scenes in slowly dilapidating Victorian and Gothic surroundings. He also commonly draws machines that feature steampunk imagery. Hellboy was made into a feature film in 2004 by director Guillermo del Toro. Mignola was closely involved with the movie's production and a sequel is currently in development. Recently, Hellboy has been made into two direct-to-video animated films, Sword of Storms and Blood and Iron in 2007. Prior to that, Mignola worked as an illustrator for Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 movie Bram Stoker's Dracula. He was also the production designer for the Disney feature film, Atlantis: The Lost Empire in 2001, and was a concept artist for 2002's Blade II, also directed by del Toro. Mignola's The Amazing Screw-On Head debuted in 2006 on the Sci-Fi Channel, starring the voices of Paul Giamatti and David Hyde Pierce</p><h2>Very Valentine: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>Soon to be a Lifetime original movie</strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;<em>Sex and the City</em> meets <em>Moonstruck</em>...this first in a new trilogy from Trigiani is sly, sensual and dripping in style.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;<em>People</em> </strong></p><p></p><p>Poignant, funny, warm, and red hot, <em>Very Valentine</em> is a wonderful treat for Adriana Trigiani fans&#x2014;a &#x201c;delightful&#x201d; (<em>Boston Globe</em>), &#x201c;romance-soaked novel&#x201d; (<em>Marie Claire</em>) from much adored playwright, screenwriter, documentary filmmaker, and <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of&nbsp;<em>The Shoemaker's&nbsp;Wife, </em><em>All the Stars in the Heavens </em>and&nbsp;<em>The Supreme Macaroni Company. </em>The adventures of an extraordinary and unforgettable woman as she attempts to rescue her family&#x2019;s struggling shoe business and find love at the same time, <em>Very</em> <em>Valentine</em> sweeps the reader from the streets of Manhattan to the picturesque hills of Italy.&nbsp;Here is yet&nbsp;another novel&nbsp;from the incomparable Trigiani that will steal your heart. <br></p></p><p><b>Book Description</b> <p> Meet the Roncalli and Angelini families, a vibrant cast of colorful characters who navigate tricky family dynamics with hilarity and brio, from magical Manhattan to the picturesque hills of bella Italia. <i>Very Valentine</i> is the first novel in a trilogy and is sure to be the new favorite of Trigiani's millions of fans around the world. </p> <p> In this luscious, contemporary family saga, the Angelini Shoe Company, makers of exquisite wedding shoes since 1903, is one of the last family-owned businesses in Greenwich Village. The company is on the verge of financial collapse. It falls to thirty-three-year-old Valentine Roncalli, the talented and determined apprentice to her grandmother, the master artisan Teodora Angelini, to bring the family's old-world craftsmanship into the twenty-first century and save the company from ruin. </p> <p> While juggling a budding romance with dashing chef Roman Falconi, her duty to her family, and a design challenge presented by a prestigious department store, Valentine returns to Italy with her grandmother to learn new techniques and seek one-of-a-kind materials for building a pair of glorious shoes to beat their rivals. There, in Tuscany, Naples, and on the Isle of Capri, a family secret is revealed as Valentine discovers her artistic voice and much more, turning her life and the family business upside down in ways she never expected. <i>Very Valentine</i> is a sumptuous treat, a journey of dreams fulfilled, a celebration of love and loss filled with Trigiani's trademark heart and humor. </p> <p> <strong>A Note from Adriana Trigiani</strong> </p><p> </p><p> The story of this novel began with a lady on a roof. Every morning, I head over to the Hudson River Park for fresh air and a run (just found out the exhaust fumes of the West Side Highway could kill me more quickly than lack of exercise, go figure), and I became obsessed with a woman living on one of the last small buildings facing the river amidst the &#x201c;progress&#x201d; of glamorous high-rises and hotels. I&#x2019;d wonder, &#x201c;Why does she stay?&#x201d; Most summer mornings she was in her housecoat tending to tomato plants that line the fence of her rooftop. I never waved or rang her bell, but I connected to her. She reminded me of my grandmothers, who had their own gardens, and for most of their widowed lives, lived alone. I began to look for the woman, and when I saw her, I felt relieved, as though life wasn&#x2019;t really racing by, and that the past was somehow, in the form of this lady, still alive.</p><p> This lady, whose name I do not know and whom I have never met, brought me to the story of Carlo Bonicelli, my grandfather, a shoemaker. I keep a photograph of him on my desk to remind me of the artisans that came before me. (It&#x2019;s a crowded desktop; those of you who read <i>Lucia, Lucia</i> know about the seamstresses in my family!) </p><p> My grandfather Carlo died when he was thirty-nine years old. My grandmother told me that while he repaired shoes and built them, his dream was to design them. He did not live long enough to see his dream materialize. With my grandmother gone, I asked my mother about him, about his work. This wasn&#x2019;t easy, as my mom cries whenever she talks about her father. As those of you dutiful children out there know, when our mothers cry, it&#x2019;s like somebody&#x2019;s plunging a knife into our chests. But this time, I asked her not to cry, and she told me the story of the Bonicelli shoes. Then I went to Italy with my dear pal Gina Casella, (with our five-year-old daughters in tow) to learn how to make shoes. I met a few of the great artisans, who became the inspiration for the shoemakers in this novel. </p><p> The trip changed my creative life, but it also changed the substance and course of this story. I come from people who survived by the labor of their own hands in a glorious country of their choice (our United States). I always knew this, but now I <i>understand</i> it. I only live as an artist because they gave me their stories, and because you read them. So, Dear Reader (love it--so Jane Austen!), <i>Very Valentine</i> is for you. It&#x2019;s about all of us: our family dynamics, our dreams, our luck or lack of it in matters of the heart, and how we negotiate going forward, in a world that&#x2019;s moving so fast, even a stroll is now a blur. This is the first of three books about Valentine Roncalli and her family of shoemakers. When I wrote it, I wanted to bring you old world craftsmanship, the magical setting of Greenwich Village, in a contemporary family saga told in vivid detail. I hope you enjoy it.</p><p></p><p>The Angelini Shoe Company, one of the last family-owned businesses in Greenwich Village, has been making exquisite wedding shoes since 1903 but now teeters on the brink of financial collapse.

Chinn Book Award Winner!</strong></p> <p>This much-needed book will help schools and, by extension, society to better understand and identify the promise, potential, and possibilities of Black boys. Drawing from their wealth of experience in early childhood education, the authors present an asset- and strengths-based view of educating Black boys. This positive approach enables practitioners and school leaders to recognize, understand, and cultivate the diversity of social skills of Black boys in the early grades (pre-K&#x2013;3rd grade). Each chapter begins with a vignette to illustrate what is lost when Black boys are prevented from participating freely in boyhood, having to instead attend to adult and peer interactions and attitudes that view them as &#x201c;bad boys&#x201d; and &#x201c;troublemakers.&#x201d; This accessible book provides teachers with classroom strategies to help young Black boys achieve their highest potential, along with other resources for supporting their social-emotional development, such as a reading list of authentic multicultural children&#x2019;s books with Black boys as protagonists.</p> <p><strong>Book Features:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Challenges deficit views of Black boys in order to transform the way schools and society think, talk, and write about them.</li> <li>Provides culturally responsive strategies for engaging Black boys and fostering healthy self-identity and agency.</li> <li>Discusses the importance of critical self-reflection to examine attitudes and practices that inform how teachers engage with children and families.</li> <li>Examines how school officials, beginning in early childhood, can stop the adultification and criminalization of Black boys.</li></ul></p><p><p><br> "My excitement about this book comes from its audacity to assert a perspective about the early education of Black boys that centers their cultural authenticity inclusive of identity, agency, and lived experiences.

Nobody expected our sleepy, midsize city to be mentioned in the same breath as New York and San Francisco. We were in our own little blissed-out bubble, oblivious to the fact that the rest of the world didn&#x2019;t have a small-batch coffee roaster on every corner, local craft beer on every tap, and pedigreed chefs cooking in food carts.<br>What was newsworthy elsewhere was simply the way of life. Of course the bartenders made their own bitters. Of course the chefs went foraging. Of course they made by hand or locally sourced everything, from the rooftop honey to the charcuterie. We never quite realized how spoiled we were until the articles arrived in a steady stream, month after month: the New York Times, Travel + Leisure, Bon App�tit, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times again, and again. And then came the James Beard nominations, followed by wins, followed by tourists coming just to eat and drink.<br>Portland, it turns out, was on the cutting edge without ever trying to be, and now our city is synonymous with DIY scrappiness, rule-breaking creativity, and a die-hard collaborative spirit. They&#x2019;re even recreating our restaurants in Tokyo&#x2015;lock, stock, and barrel.<br>We get it now. We know how lucky we are. And if we forget, it only takes a trip out of town to remind us. It wasn&#x2019;t always like this, though, despite Portland&#x2019;s claim to fame as the hometown of James Beard himself.

The ingredients at our fingertips are nothing short of inspiring.<br>You could say the relatively cheap rent, and even cheaper liquor licenses, makes it easier for entrepreneurial chefs and artisan producers to strike out on their own, free to follow their bliss without any corporate handcuffs.<br>Or you could say it&#x2019;s in our culture, a captive audience of curious and knowledgeable food lovers who know their Hood strawberries from their Seascapes, who welcome culinary risk taking, who don&#x2019;t stand for mediocrity. You can try anything here, but it better be good.<br>I say it&#x2019;s all of those things, but they would mean nothing without our deep pool of talent in front of the stoves and behind the bars. The uncompromising creativity of the chefs, bartenders, restaurateurs, and food producers driving our food scene is our richest resource. And that&#x2019;s what this book is all about.<br>These pages are a celebration of the pioneers, game changers, upstarts, and torch bearers who help put Portland on the culinary map. These are the talents at the beating heart of it all, and they&#x2019;re graciously sharing some of their greatest hits with us. Some recipes are an adventure, requiring a trip to the Asian market, while others are a snap to pull off on any given weeknight. But they&#x2019;re all fantastic and eminently doable (and we have an army of home-cook recipe testers to prove it).<br>Through their recipes, these chefs and bartenders offer a glimpse of what goes into your favorite dishes. And together, their stories paint a portrait of what makes life in Portland so delicious.</p><h2>The Vampire Diaries: The Return: Midnight (Vampire Diaries: The Return, 3)</h2><p><p><em><strong>New York Times </strong></em><strong>bestselling series</strong></p><p><em>The Return: Midnight</em> is the seventh book in L.J.

Culled from thousands of his <i>Tribune</i> columns and edited by his son David Royko, this collection offers up his best material from the last stage in his career, which was cut short by his premature death in 1997.</p><p>Born and raised in Chicago, <b>Mike Royko</b> (1932&#x2013;1997) produced more than 7,500 daily columns for the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>, and the <i>Chicago Daily News</i>.

He won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 1972.</p><h2>Mind to Mind: An Essay Towards a Philosophy of Education</h2><p>This is Charlotte Mason as you have not seen her before: <em>Mind to Mind</em> is her well-seasoned final work, originally titled <em>An Essay Towards a Philosophy of Education</em>. Divested of outdated material, the essential philosophy is brought into sharp relief. Ms. Mason wrote, &#x201c;The message for our age is, Believe in mind, and let education go straight as a bolt to the mind of the pupil.&#x201d; Our generation needs to hear that message more acutely than ever. Karen Glass, with deep respect for the original, has preserved the essentials in Ms. Mason&#x2019;s own words, while delivering the material in a format that speaks to today&#x2019;s readers. This book is an abridgment in the literal Latin sense of &#x201c;to shorten.&#x201d; What has been shortened is not merely the length of the original volume, but the path between the modern reader and the mind of Charlotte Mason. <br> <br> In this book, Charlotte Mason presents the vital principles that underlie her methods, and with the confidence of many decades of practice behind her, recommends those methods to a wider audience. She wanted to reform and regenerate the educational practices of Great Britain in the early 20th century, but 21st century readers will find her ideas just as potent, just as penetrating, and even more refreshing than they were when they were originally penned. Her first principle is "Children are born persons": not machines, not animals, not accidental conglomerations of cells, but persons, with all the magnificent possibilities that personhood implies. The education we should offer a person is the education Charlotte Mason offers to us.</p><p>Charlotte Mason was a 19th/20th-century British educator who pioneered a movement to bring liberal education to all children. She founded a grassroots organization of parents and educators (Parents&#39; National Education Union) and a teacher training college. Her books and wisdom continue to inspire 21st-century educators. Karen Glass, one of the founders of Ambleside Online (amblesideonline.org), and author of Consider This: Charlotte Mason and the Classical Tradition (www.karenglass.net) has homeschooled her children for twenty years according the methods developed by Charlotte Mason, and continues to read and learn about educational philosophy.</p><h2>Curvy Girl Crochet: 25 Patterns that Fit and Flatter</h2><p><p>Full-figured women who love to crochet will rejoice in this fun, fresh, and pretty new book, <em><strong>Curvy Girl Crochet:</strong> <strong>25 Patterns that Fit and Flatter</strong></em>.

He produced the Al Green boxed set Anthology, for which his liner notes were nominated for a Grammy Award in 1998. He lives in Memphis with his wife and two children.*Starred Review* Gordon's biography of Muddy Waters starts on Stovall's farm, where a barefoot McKinley Morganfield--Muddy's birth name--heard that "a white man was looking for him." That was Alan Lomax, who recorded guitarist Muddy's repertoire (see appendix for a list) for the Library of Congress. Muddy "didn't know what did he mean by the Library of Congress," but he got wise soon, moved to Chicago, switched to electric guitar, and created the quintessential urban blues sound. Throughout, Gordon details the gritty life reflected in Muddy's lyrics--you almost need a scorecard to keep up with the familial and extra-familial affairs of Muddy, his wives, and his outside women--rather than slings music theory, thereby creating the least tidied-up biography of a bluesman in ages, it seems. He makes Muddy the musician, Muddy the man, Muddy the parent, and Muddy the tool of the (not so) sainted Chess brothers come alive. You can feel the ugly winds of racism, hear the cacophony of the Chicago ghetto (Muddy's house stood on the dividing line between the Blackstone Rangers' and the Devil's Disciples' turfs), and share the exhilaration of Muddy's music--not to mention his way of living: told that liquor was killing him, he switched to champagne and recorded "Champagne and Reefer." Packed with facts, copiously referenced, and featuring a foreword by blues aficionado and riff-copper Keith Richards, this book is absolutely essential for any popular music collection worthy of the name. <i>Mike Tribby</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This accessibly written volume summarizes the content of each major section of the biblical text to help readers quickly grasp the sense of particular passages.<br><br>This is the first volume in the Handbooks on the New Testament series, which is modeled after Baker Academic's successful Old Testament handbook series. Series volumes are neither introductions nor commentaries, as they focus primarily on the content of the biblical books without getting bogged down in historical-critical questions or detailed verse-by-verse exegesis. The series will contain three volumes that span the entirety of the New Testament, with future volumes covering the Gospels and Hebrews through Revelation. Written with classroom utility and pastoral application in mind, these books will appeal to students, pastors, and laypeople alike.</p><p>The Handbooks on the New Testament series focuses primarily on the content of the biblical books without getting bogged down in historical-critical questions or detailed verse-by-verse exegesis.<br><br>Benjamin L. Gladd, series editor<br><br>"This new textbook is highly informative, consistently comprehensive, and eminently accessible. With his customary acumen as a scholar and his pastoral sensitivity as a teacher,&nbsp;Schreiner introduces his readers to the complex realities of the first-century world, the missionary work of the earliest missionaries, and the theological emphases of Luke and Paul, two of the most prolific theologians of the early church, without losing sight of the foundational convictions that the early followers of Jesus lived and died for."<br>--<b>Eckhard&nbsp;J. Schnabel</b>, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary<br><br>"Some commentaries are so chock-full of detailed treatment of minute exegetical issues that it is easy to miss the forest for the trees. Others are so superficial that they say little that is not already obvious from a casual reading of the Scripture. Schreiner's <i>Handbook</i> strikes a proper balance between the two extremes. The fruit of his years of careful scholarly study in Paul's Letters is hanging on low limbs where it is easy to pick and enjoy.

But this community once had an impact on American history that rivaled the far larger black worlds of Harlem and Chicago. It published the most widely read black newspaper in the country, urging black voters to switch from the Republican to the Democratic Party, and then rallying black support for World War II. It fielded two of the greatest baseball teams of the Negro Leagues and introduced Jackie Robinson to the Brooklyn Dodgers. Pittsburgh was the childhood home of jazz pioneers Billy Strayhorn, Billy Eckstine, Earl Hines, Mary Lou Williams, and Erroll Garner; Hall of Fame slugger Josh Gibson&#x2014;and August Wilson himself.

Both moving and perversely funny, Mortal Lessons is an established classic that considers not only the workings and misworkings of the human body, but also the meaning of life and death. And although Dr. Selzer&#39;s dark humor makes the burgeoning tumors and ulcerations of his essays more bearable, he is frank about the mysterious and dreaded inevitable - the sometime surprise, as he calls it, at the center of surgery: death. Behind his traditional &#34;surgeon&#39;s arrogance&#34; the reader will find endearing self-mockery, a very real empathy for his patients, and the ready suggestion that even the surgeon is still very small when he stands before nature.Richard Selzer (1928&#x2013;2016) was for many years a surgeon practicing in New Haven, Connecticut, where he was also on the faculty of the Yale School of Medicine. He was born in Troy, New York, was graduated from Union College and Albany Medical College, and from the Surgical Training Program of Yale University. In 1975 he won the National Magazine Award for his essays on medicine.

Then, on the day she gives birth to their first baby, James informs her that he's leaving her. Claire is left with a newborn daughter, a broken heart, and a postpartum body that she can hardly bear to look at.</p><p>She decides to go home to Dublin. And there, sheltered by the love of a quirky family, she gets better. So much so, in fact, that when James slithers back into her life, he's in for a bit of a surprise.</p></p><p><p>Marian Keyes is the author of ten bestselling novels and two essay collections. She lives in Ireland with her husband and their two imaginary dogs.</p>A grand first novel by Irish writer Keyes is a hilarious treatise on loves roller coaster. Both elated and exhausted after giving birth to a daughter, the 29-year-old Claire is shocked senseless when her husband James comes to the London hospital not to celebrate, but instead to break the news that he's leaving her for their dowdy downstairs neighbor. The stunned Claire, with new baby in tow, and feeling as big as a summer melon, hightails it back to her family in Dublin to sort out her life. Wandering around her childhood home in her mother's old nightgowns, a vodka bottle in one hand and the bawling Kate in the other, Claire tries to banish images of the frolicking James and his ``other woman.'' Her two younger sisters prove to be a comfortsweet Anna, a hippie drug-dealer, loans Claire money for booze, and haughty Helen deigns to buy it for her. And drunken anguish does have its rewards, for in no time Claire sheds her extra weight, thanks to a steady liquid diet and nights spent on the family rowing machine fantasizing Jamess ruin. But it is only when Gorgeous Adam appears on the scene that Claire begins to recover a sense of purpose. A college friend of Helen's, Adam exemplifies perfect manhood--and helpfully takes a liking to her, too. But just as things begin crackling between them, James shows up, oh-so- generously ready to forgive Claire for driving him into the arms of the other woman. Torn between the comforts of her former life in London and a new, heartening sense of self-worth and self-sufficiencynot to mention the Gorgeous AdamClaire finds herself hard put to make a decision.

Medical knowledge and technology are advancing faster than we can learn to apply them wisely. The pace of change threatens the humanistic aspects of patient care. The arts of listening, observing and examining, and the values of professionalism, ethics, and humor are threatened; both patient and physician are dissatisfied. It is time to restore balance in the care of patients by reinforcing the importance of these skills&#x2014;and this groundbreaking book does just that. By sharing remarkable patient stories accumulated over almost six decades, Dr. Paul Griner shows how the somewhat elusive concepts intrinsic to &#x201c;the art&#x201d; of medicine can be better understood and applied in the day to day care of patients. Provocative questions at the end of each story challenge the reader to avoid a premature response, reflect more deeply on the question and learn how much of medicine is not black and white. Included are such compelling questions as: How do you respond to a parent who insists that her twenty-two year old daughter not be told she has leukemia?, What do you say to the mother of a nineteen year &#x2013;old son who begs to let him die so that he can be relieved of the agonizing complications of his aplastic anemia?, How do you advise the pregnant wife of a medical resident who wishes to defer treatment for Hodgkin&#x2019;s Disease, for months, until after the baby is born?, How do you account for a patient whose leukemia disappears without treatment?, How do you respond to the death of a patient from an intern&#x2019;s careless act? These and almost fifty other stories provide a rich learning experience for both patients and health care professionals alike. A clarion call to balance humanism and technology for the benefits of a system that is breaking apart, Dr. Griner&#x2019;s collection of stories is a revelation. Exploring the variety of patient problems to delineate points of learning and personal growth, The Power of Patient Stories, Learning Moments in Medicine is a must read for patients and health professions students.</p><p>Paul Griner is an Emeritus Professor of Medicine at the University of Rochester School of Medicine &amp; Dentistry, Rochester, N.Y. He was also a Senior Lecturer at Harvard and Consultant at the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Institute for HealthCare Improvement in Cambridge, Mass.

A Clinical Psychologist Espousing Tarot Cards?</em> Dr. Arthur Rosengarten, in <em>Tarot and Psychology: Spectrums of Possibility</em>, does just that. He explains Tarot to those who may want to learn to use it properly for the greatest good&#x2013;individuals who desire greater spirituality in their lives, including the benefits of psychological insight and depth, without the baggage of affiliation that invariably accompanies any single set of beliefs. Tarot, they will soon find, operates on many levels of profound meaning from a purely non-affiliated platform in the truest sense. Tarot makes accessible to awareness a full spectrum of psychological and spiritual possibility with little preference for its user&#x2019;s qualifications or beliefs. Rather magically, one might say, Tarot captures the heartbeat of experience. This fact alone should make the deck of human possibility immediately relevant to helping professionals who deal with the heartbeats of experience daily.</p> <p>The use of Tarot as an oracle for creating awareness and gaining insight into particular symptoms, problems or questions&#x2013;i.e. Tarot divination&#x2013;is often mentioned as an afterthought, alongside other meditational exercises and alternative spread configurations. Yet today, the vast majority of individuals who have discovered the wonders and mysteries of Tarot have done so through experiences of divination. Card reading, without a doubt, is Tarot&#x2019;s most beguiling and potentially beneficial enterprise. Why dance around the magic?</p> <p>For Tarot to continue to evolve into the 21st century (and beyond) it must have a stronger application emphasis, that is, it must be relevant, accessible, and meaningful to the changing contours of people&#x2019;s lives. It must resonate with all who seek greater meaning, creativity, and awareness, not simply with small segments of the waning New Age.</p> <p><em>Tarot and Psychology provides an innovative new approach for understanding the psychological and spiritual possibilities of human experience.</em></p></p><p>Arthur Rosengarten, PhD.is a clinical psychologist in private practice for over 35 years.He wrote the first accredited doctoral dissertation on tarot (1985), which was compared experimentally with dream interpretation and projective storytelling. In addition to seeing private clients for psychotherapy, he teaches Intuition Mind Seminars and The Tarot Circle, now in its 25th year. He has been an Adjunct Graduate Professor of Psychology at a number of universities in the area. He has lectured on the psychology of Tarot widely, including major conferences throughout the US, in China and India. Rosengarten is author of Tarot and Psychology: Spectrums of Possibility and creator of the <em>Tarot of the Nine Paths: Advanced Tarot Deck for the Spiritual Traveler.</em>"This book is a wonderful support document for the power of Tarot as a counseling tool. Mr. Rosengarten writes in a very clear and casual style which makes complex concepts understand-able to the lay person. This book is a valuable companion to the core books.... Somewhat technical at times, the author's "every-day" references and context clarify within the body of the work, making frequent trips to a dictionary unnecessary. There were a few sections that were theoretically over my head, but their content was not necessary to follow these document to it's logical conclusion. Bravo!"&#x2015;Errol McLendon, Taroist, Chicago, IL<br><br>"In this outstanding, groundbreaking work, Art Rosengarten, a licensed clinical psychologist, sets the stage for a new integration of psychology and Tarot.... Cutting across methodologies, theories, and statistics, Tarot emphasizes the "heartbeat of experience"...Rosengarten does an excellent job of defining terms and explaining techniques so that they make sense to the lay reader. He also uses exciting real-life examples and stories to make his methods crystal clear and demonstrate their practicality.... This book is truly innovative and exciting, by a therapist and tarot reader possessing a compassionate and poetic soul that radiates through each word he writes."&#x2015;Mary K. Greer, TAROT Newsletter, Summer 2000<br><br>"This is a book that challenges the thinking of both practicing clinical psychologist and practicing Tarot readers...this work is based on solid clinical training and the author's own extensive research and practical clinical experience. The author has developed a Spectrum of Possibility for each card in the Tarot deck. These spectra are not the cut and dried "card meanings"...but rich shades of psychological meaning...the author explains the Jungian Theory of Synchronicity, that is, the notion of acausality. This is the most lucid and uncomplicated exposition of this important and oft misunderstood subject. This is a "must read" for clinicians who are looking for new approaches to old problems and for Tarotists looking for a work with more depth and meaning than yet another description of the archetypal images of the Major Arcana."&#x2015;Linda Gail Walters, Student of Tarot, San Diego, CA<br><br>"Rosengarten's remarkable work spans the abyss that yawns between psychology and mysticism, and does so without diminishment to art or science."&#x2015;Lon Milo DuQuette, Author of Tarot Of Ceremonial Magick<br><br>"Were I still in practice, I would test for myself the integration of Tarot (and other mantic methods) into analysis, something this book has given me courage to attempt."&#x2015;James A. Hall, MD, Author of Jungian Dream Interpretation</p><h2>Spiritual Direction: A Guide to Giving and Receiving Direction</h2><p>We are not alone. God is present with us. And God gives us companions on the journey. A spiritual director is one such companion, offering spiritual guidance to help <ul><li>make sense of the faith journey</li><li>interpret the significant markers on the road</li><li>encourage us, particularly through the more difficult transitions and valleys of our pilgrimage</li><li>and, most of all, to notice the ministry of the Spirit in our lives</li></ul> Gordon Smith writes: Even if we have been Christians and maturing in our faith for many years, we still need the encouragement and guidance that might come through spiritual direction. . . . Genuine humility is evident in our realization that we need a companion, a fellow pilgrim and Christian, who can help us discern and foster an attentiveness to God's presence in our lives. This is the gift of spiritual direction.

Smith is president and professor of systematic and spiritual theology at Ambrose University College and Seminary in Calgary, Alberta. He is the author of many books, including <em>Courage and Calling</em> and <em>The Voice of Jesus.</em>"There has been a growing hunger among evangelicals for the sort of spiritual direction the Jesuits have been doing for centuries, but little guidance for those who would seek to give or receive such direction. Gordon Smith is just the right person at just the right time to offer a concise guide for the ministry of direction today. There is nothing faddish here. This short book is the fruit of practical wisdom gained over many years experience in spiritual direction, and it is marked by a deep appreciation for Scripture and the church's teaching and practice through the centuries." (Bruce Hindmarsh, professor of spiritual theology, Regent College, Vancouver)<br><br>"In this welcome addition to the growing literature on Christian spiritual direction, theologian Gordon Smith invites believers and the church to notice God at work through this long-treasured discipline. Writing with mind and heart engaged, Smith weaves together theology, biblical teaching, church history and wisdom from his experience of spiritual direction to craft a svelte and helpful book that will bless anyone considering becoming a director or directee, and, in fact, any person on the lookout for truly nourishing Christian spirituality." (Susan S. Phillips, professor at New College Berkeley and author of Candlelight)<br><br>"What a perfectly cut gem of a book this is: wise, clear, concise and practical, it instructs in the art of spiritual direction while at the same moment inspiring us to give and receive it. Gordon Smith distills his considerable knowledge of this vital topic and bestows on us something useful and beautiful, simple and substantial. This book brims with insights and has not a wasted word anywhere."

It is a marriage of militarism and utopian ideology, of unprecedented military might wed to a blind faith in the universality of American values. This mindset, Bacevich warns, invites endless war and the ever-deepening militarization of U.S. policy. It promises not to perfect but to pervert American ideals and to accelerate the hollowing out of American democracy. <br><br>In <em>The New American Militarism</em>, Bacevich examines the origins and implications of this misguided enterprise. He shows how American militarism emerged as a reaction to the Vietnam War, when various groups in American society -soldiers, politicians on the make, intellectuals, strategists, Christian evangelicals, even purveyors of pop culture-came to see the revival of military power and the celebration of military values as the antidote to all the ills besetting the country as a consequence of Vietnam and the 1960s. The upshot, acutely evident in the aftermath of 9/11, has been a revival of vast ambitions, this time coupled with a pronounced affinity for the sword. Bacevich urges Americans to restore a sense of realism and a sense of proportion to U.S. policy. He proposes, in short, to bring American purposes and American methods-especially with regard to the role of the military-back into harmony with the nation's founding ideals.<br><br>For this edition, Bacevich has written a new Afterword in which he considers how American militarism has changed in the past five years. He explores in particular how this ideology has functioned under Barack Obama, who ran for president on a campaign based on hope for change and for a new beginning. Despite such rhetoric, Bacevich powerfully suggests, the attitudes and arrangements giving rise to the new American militarism remain intact and inviolable as ever.</p><p><br><strong>Andrew J. Bacevich</strong> is Professor of History and International Relations at Boston University. A graduate of West Point and a Vietnam Veteran, he has a doctorate in history from Princeton and was a Bush Fellow at the American Academy in Berlin. He is the author of several books, including <em>Washington</em> <em>Rules: America's Path to Permanent War</em>, and the New York Times best-seller <em>The Limits of Power</em>.<br><br>"Bacevich is a graduate of West Point, a Vietnam veteran, and a conservative Catholic.... He has thus earned the right to a hearing even in circles typically immune to criticism. What he writes should give them pause.... His conclusion is clear. The United States is becoming not just a militarized state but a military society: a country where armed power is the measure of national greatness, and war, or planning for war, is the exemplary (and only) common project."--Tony Judt, <em>The New York Review of Books</em><p></p><br>"Every thoughtful American should read this book.... He has a very important story to tell and tells it well.... Bacevich's main argument...is the most powerful and compelling part of his highly original analysis.... He concludes with a chapter on what to do, which is utterly sound if politically impossible."--Chalmers Johnson, <em>San Diego Union-Tribune</em><p></p><br>"A concise, sinewy book that looks at the emperor and concludes that indeed he has no clothes.... Bacevich makes the case calmly but with piercing clarity.... His judgments and his point of view are evenhanded and steady.... Acute and unsparing."--Andrew Day, <em>Los Angeles Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"A valuable account of the paradoxical consequences of the U.S. effort to recover from Vietnam.... Bacevich--a Boston University professor, West Point alumnus and Vietnam veteran --demonstrates a fine grasp of past debates on military matters and an ability to relate them to today's events and personalities."--Lawrence Freedman, <em>Washington Post Book World</em><p></p><br>"Intellectually serious. Writing very much as a Vietnam veteran, he worries that both major political parties have become too trigger-happy, too keen to dispatch troops abroad. Bacevich takes a dim view of Bush's rhetoric about freedom and argues that the United States' dependence on oil is why it is fighting in the Middle East. He thinks that what some neo-conservatives call World War IV didn't start on 9/11 but in 1980, when Jimmy Carter, having failed to persuade Americans to cut down on their use of gas, declared that any attempt by an 'outside force' to take over the Persian Gulf would be met by a US military response. Bacevich details America's inglorious history in the region to illustrate his point."--James G. Forsyth, <em>Boston Globe</em><p></p><br>"A provocative book.... Anyone with an interest in U.S. military, diplomatic, or political history, or in civil-military relations, or in current military policy should seriously consider Bacevich's argument and proposals, and the book should be required reading for all students at the nation's staff and war colleges."--<em>Military History</em><p></p><br>"Brilliant, abrasive, important.... The epitaph for a blindly ideological, overly militarized, and self-defeating imperialism. His bravely outspoken book will enlighten many and infuriate more than a few."--Richard J. Whalen, <em>Across the Board</em><p></p><br>"Some of the most trenchant and original criticism of the trajectory of U.S. foreign and military policy that has surfaced since the U.S. invasion of Iraq in March, 2003."--<em>Inter Press Service</em><p></p><br>"Andrew Bacevich has become perhaps the leading critic of America's preoccupation with military power. As a former professional soldier, he writes with great understanding of the military as an institution and of the path its leaders have taken since Vietnam. Bacevich explains trenchantly how, over the past 30 years, America's political and intellectual elites have all contributed to this country's overemphasis on war, soldiers and military solutions." --James Mann, author of <em>Rise of the Vulcans: The History of Bush's War Cabinet</em><p></p><br>"Buy this, read this, and make others do the same, but only if you are open to new perspectives. Bacevich brings a gimlet eye to an array of subjects. Here are some of the freshest observations available on contemporary American military affairs, political life and popular culture--indeed, probably too fresh and challenging for many readers, right and left." --Thomas E. Ricks, Military Correspondent, <em>The Washington Post</em>, and author of <em>Making the Corps</em> and <em>A Soldier's Duty</em><p></p><br>"A superbly researched, articulate book that compellingly challenges the basic assumptions of the use of American military power in the turbulent years since World War II. A clarion call for reform, <em>The New American Militarism</em> offers a blueprint for the 21st century that should be compulsory reading for the military establishment, Congress, the White House, and for every citizen concerned with how the United States wages war."--Carlo D'Este, author of <em>Eisenhower: A Soldier's Life</em> and <em>Patton: A Genius For War</em><p></p><br>"A concise, sinewy book that looks at the emperor and concludes that indeed he has no clothes....

This 'compendium' was intended as an introductory handbook for students and scholars who might not have access to the larger work. It remains the best concise introduction to Aquinas's thought. Furthermore, it is extremely interesting to scholars because it represents Aquinas's last word on these topics. Aquinas does not break new ground or re-think earlier positions but often states them more directly and with greater precision than can be found elsewhere. There is only one available English translation of the Compendium (published as 'Aquinas's Shorter Summa: Saint Thomas's Own Concise Version of his Summa Theologiae,' by Sophia Institute Press). It is published by a very small Catholic publishing house, is marketed to the devotional readership, contains no scholarly apparatus. Richard Regan is a highly respected Aquinas translator, who here relies on the definitive Leonine edition of the Latin text. His work will be received as the premier English version of this important text.<br></p><p>Richard J.

However, like most political buzzwords, the term often floats from one meaning to another, and both social scientists and journalists use it to denote diverse phenomena. What is populism really? Who are the populist leaders? And what is the relationship between populism and democracy? This book answers these questions in a simple and persuasive way, offering a swift guide to populism in theory and practice.<br><br>Cas Mudde and Crist�bal Rovira Kaltwasser present populism as an ideology that divides society into two antagonistic camps, the "pure people" versus the "corrupt elite," and that privileges the general will of the people above all else. They illustrate the practical power of this ideology through a survey of representative populist movements of the modern era: European right-wing parties, left-wing presidents in Latin America, and the Tea Party movement in the United States. The authors delve into the ambivalent personalities of charismatic populist leaders such as Juan Domingo P�ron, H. Ross Perot, Jean-Marie le Pen, Silvio Berlusconi, and Hugo Ch�vez. If the strong male leader embodies the mainstream form of populism, many resolute women, such as Eva P�ron, Pauline Hanson, and Sarah Palin, have also succeeded in building a populist status, often by exploiting gendered notions of society.<br><br>Although populism is ultimately part of democracy, populist movements constitute an increasing challenge to democratic politics. Comparing political trends across different countries, this compelling book debates what the long-term consequences of this challenge could be, as it turns the spotlight on the bewildering effect of populism on today's political and social life.<br></p><p><br><strong>Crist�bal Rovira Kaltwasser</strong> is Associate Professor of Political Science at the Diego Portales University's School of Political Science in Chile.

The textbook <em>Harmony,</em> <em>Counterpoint, Partimento</em> is its final outcome.<br><br>"IJzerman has developed a historically informed approach to eighteenth- and nineteenth-century harmony and counterpoint, one which takes advantage of the old keyboard exercises known as partimenti. The benefits of those lessons are well known, but until now no one had put together a text that adapted them for the modern classroom. IJzerman covers the era from Bach through Brahms, provides a teacher's manual, and an extensive workbook. If you have bright students, this is the text they would want if they had the choice." -- Robert O. Gjerdingen, Professor Emeritus at The School of Music, Northwestern University<p></p><br>"Drawing on recent research on partimento and eighteenth-century schemata, IJzerman's <em>Harmony, Counterpoint, Partimento</em> is unlike any other textbook on the market. Its emphasis on the bass line as the driver of harmonic motion is especially praiseworthy." -- Roger Graybill, New England Conservatory<p></p><br></p><h2>The New Mythic Tarot</h2><p><p>From the time of its first publication in 1986, <i>The Mythic Tarot </i>has sold over a million copies in dozens of countries.

Now that she has died, she is afraid to face them and finally admit to herself that her thirty-seven years of life were meaningless, error-ridden, and forgettable. So Helena lingers, a silent observer haunted by the life she left behind-her shattered attorney husband, David; her houseful of damaged but beloved animals; and her final project, Cindy, a chimpanzee trained to use sign language who may be able to unlock the mysteries of animal communication and consciousness. <br>When Cindy is scheduled for a research experiment that will undoubtedly take her life, David must call upon everything he has learned from Helena to save her.

His family lived on a farm in Pennsylvania for several years then returned to Elmira until Tedd was ten years old. His father's work then required that they move to Gainesville, Florida. There, Tedd's first art lessons in an abandoned dentist's office over the Happy Hour pool hall eventually led to a fine arts degree from the University of Florida. He and his wife, Carol, started their family in Tallahassee where Tedd worked as a commercial illustrator. Carol, a Kindergarten teacher, drew Tedd's attention to children's books. Their first son, Walter, inspired his breakthrough picture book, <i>No Jumping on the Bed!</i>. His second son, William, now stars in <i>No More Water in the Tub!</i>, a sequel to his first book. He has now published more than 30 books as author and illustrator. When not working on his books, Tedd's interests include tennis, sketching, reading, coin collecting, and the computer.<p>"The inspiration to begin writing and illustrating for children came from my wife, Carol. As a kindergarten teacher, she collected picture books. I was attracted to their colorful pages and the way the words and pictures played with each other, much like the captioned cartoons I had drawn when I was young.</p><p>"Perhaps the biggest surprise of my career as an author is that I'm now going back to elementary school! Visiting young readers in classrooms and libraries is something I love. Kids keep me on my toes and they ask a lot of questions. The number one question seems to be, 'Where do you getyour ideas?' It's also the hardest question to answer because every idea is different. Some ideas seem to pop out of thin air -- while I'm in the shower or walking the dog. Others come from reading or research. But most of my ideas come from my family and the things they do and say.</p><p>"For instance, one time when my first son, Walter, was five years old, I found him lying on the couch, looking pale as a ghost and clutching a Bible to his chest. He was praying! When I asked what was wrong, he wouldn't answer. In fact, he wouldn't even open his mouth. My wife, Carol, finally coaxed a response from him: he pointed inside his mouth. Carol exclaimed, 'You have a loose tooth!' Walter's eyes nearly popped out with fright. We quickly assured him that it was perfectly okay for his tooth to come loose and that a new one would replace it. But Carol and I looked at each other and realized that despite all our efforts to be good parents, we had somehow completely forgotten to warn Walter that teeth fall out! He had thought he was falling apart! I made a little note in my journal; then ten years later, I expanded that memory into my book <i>Parts</i>."</p><p>Tedd Arnold lives in Elmira, New York, with his wife, Carol, two sons, Walter and William, two cats, Cody and Frankie, and one dog, Hershey.</p><p>copyright ? 2000 by Penguin Putnam Books for Young Readers.

Annie is famous in her town of Burskyville for her amazing ability to maneuver her bus through any snowstorm. Not even the specter of the towering incline known as Tiger Hill can intimidate her. Thus the Burskyville schools never close, much to the disgruntlement of Shifty, who'd like a snow day now and then. When Shifty conspires with Hale Snow, owner of a local ski resort, to whip up a doozy of a snowstorm on Tiger Hill (with a little help from Hale's snowmaking machine), it appears that Annie has met her match. However, her generosity in the past to all the stranded motorists is returned when they push her up the hill. With hilarious, over-the-top characters, this satisfyingly outrageous tale will tickle readers' funny bones. Arnold's spunky illustrations capture the tongue-in-cheek spirit of the text and his characterization of the curmudgeonly Shifty help make this blustery tale the perfect antidote for the winter doldrums.

Off-road riding takes many forms, from motocross and enduro racing, to dual-sport day trips, to trail riding, to adventure tours. No matter the specific pursuit, all dirt riding (and much street riding) shares the same basic skill set.</p>&nbsp;<i>How to Ride Off-Road Motorcycles</i> schools the reader in all the skills necessary to ride safely and quickly off-road. Chapters cover the basics, such as body position, turning, braking, and throttle control, then proceed to advanced techniques, such as sliding, jumps, wheelies, hill-climbing, and more.&nbsp;If you've ever wanted to try dirt riding or if you're an experienced rider looking to sharpen your skill set, <i>How to Ride Off-Road Motorcycles </i>is a perfect riding coach.</p><p><p>&nbsp;</p>To the uninitiated, riding an off-road motorcycle may look as easy as sitting down, putting your feet on the pegs, and twisting the throttle. But for anyone who has ever tried to tackle an off-road trail or even a gravel road on a dirt bike, they know that there is so much more skill involved than meets the eye.&nbsp;At any given moment, both hands and both feet are busy working the clutch, brakes, and transmission. At the same time, the rider is transferring his weight just so, all while applying a precise amount of throttle to keep the bike upright and moving. In other words, it&#x2019;s not as easy as it looks!&nbsp;Learning to ride a dirt bike with no guidance is not only risky and time-consuming, but prevents you from reaching your full potential. In <i>How to Ride Off-Road Motorcycles, </i>author Gary LaPlante takes his many years as a dirt bike riding instructor and lays out a proven step-by-step practice guide for any rider interested in heading off-road or sharpening his bike-handling skills. He begins with the basics of shifting, stopping, and turning, and moves on to more advanced techniques such as hill climbing, wheelies, jumping, and power slides. How to handle specific trail obstacles such as rocks, ruts, and water crossings is also detailed in the colorful how-to photo sequences found throughout the book.&nbsp;Gary also gives sound advice on how to choose the bike that&#x2019;s right for you and how to maintain it for optimum performance; how to deal with the weather, altitude, and trail conditions found throughout the country; off-road etiquette; and racing techniques for motocross and trials competitions. Additionally, he makes it clear how street riders&#x2019; on-road skills are improved by understanding how to handle a bike off road.&nbsp;Following the steps in<i> How to Ride an Off-Road Motorcycle </i>is the best investment you can make to ensure a safe, enjoyable, and rewarding dirt bike experience.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Lee Parks</b> is the author of the best-selling riding skills book <i>Total Control</i>.

He had begun to feel like he was being watched&nbsp;the instant he and his father had entered the Maw&nbsp;cluster, and the deeper they advanced, the stronger the&nbsp;sensation grew. Now, at the very heart of the concentration&nbsp;of black holes, the feeling was a constant chill&nbsp;at the base of his skull.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;"I sense it, too," his father said. He was sitting&nbsp;behind Ben in the copilot's seat, up on the primary&nbsp;flight deck. "We're not alone in here."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;No longer surprised that the Grand Master of the&nbsp;Jedi Order always seemed to know his thoughts, Ben&nbsp;glanced at an activation reticle in the front of the cockpit.&nbsp;A small section of canopy opaqued into a mirror,&nbsp;and he saw his father's reflection staring out the side of&nbsp;the canopy. Luke Skywalker looked more alone and&nbsp;pensive than Ben ever remembered seeing him&#x2013;&nbsp;thoughtful, but not sad or frightened, as though he&nbsp;were merely trying to understand what had brought&nbsp;him to such a dark and isolated place, banished from&nbsp;an Order he had founded, and exiled from a society he&nbsp;had spent his life fighting to defend.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Trying not to dwell on the injustice of the situation,&nbsp;Ben said, "So maybe we're closing in. Not that I'm all&nbsp;that eager to meet a bunch of beings called the Mind&nbsp;Drinkers."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;His father thought for a moment, then said, "Well,&nbsp;I am."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;He didn't elaborate, and he didn't need to. Ben and&nbsp;his father were on a mission to retrace Jacen Solo's fiveyear&nbsp;odyssey of Force exploration. At their last stop,&nbsp;they had learned from an Aing- Tii monk that Jacen had&nbsp;been bound for the Maw when he departed the Kathol&nbsp;Rift. Since one purpose of their journey was to determine&nbsp;whether Jacen had been nudged toward the dark&nbsp;side by something on his voyage, it only made sense&nbsp;that Luke would want to investigate a mysterious&nbsp;Maw- dwelling group known as the Mind Drinkers.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;What impressed Ben, however, was how calm his&nbsp;father seemed about it all. Ben was privately terrified of&nbsp;falling victim to the same darkness that had claimed his&nbsp;cousin. Yet his father seemed eager to step into its depth&nbsp;and strike a flame. And why shouldn't he be? After&nbsp;everything that Luke Skywalker had suffered and&nbsp;achieved in his lifetime, there was no power in the&nbsp;galaxy that could draw him into darkness. It was a&nbsp;strength that both awed Ben and inspired him, one that&nbsp;he wondered if he would ever find himself.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Luke' s eyes shifted toward the mirrored canopy section,&nbsp;and he caught Ben's gaze. "Is this what bothered you&nbsp;when you were at Shelter?" He was referring to a time&nbsp;that was ancient history to Ben&#x2013;the last part of the war&nbsp;with the Yuuzhan Vong, when the Jedi had been forced to&nbsp;hide their young at a secret base deep inside the Maw.&nbsp;"Did you feel like someone was watching you?"&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; "How should I know?" Ben asked, suddenly&nbsp;uneasy&#x2013; and unsure why. By all accounts, he had been&nbsp;an unruly, withdrawn toddler while he was at Shelter,&nbsp;and he recalled being afraid of the Force for years afterward.&nbsp;But he had no clear memories of Shelter itself, or&nbsp;what it had felt like to be there. "I was <i>two.</i>"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"You <i>did </i>have feelings when you were two," his&nbsp;father said mildly. "You <i>did </i>have a mind."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Ben sighed, knowing what his father wanted, then&nbsp;said, "You'd better take the ship."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"I have the ship," Luke confirmed, reaching for the&nbsp;copilot's yoke. "Just close your eyes. Let the Force carry&nbsp;your thoughts back to Shelter."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;"I know how to meditate." Almost instantly, Ben felt&nbsp;bad for grumbling and added, "But thanks for the&nbsp;advice."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"Don't mention it," Luke said in a good- natured&nbsp;way. "That's what fathers <i>do&#x2013;</i>offer unwanted advice."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Ben closed his eyes and began to breathe slowly and&nbsp;deliberately. Each time he inhaled, he drew the Force&nbsp;into himself, and each time he exhaled, he sent it flowing&nbsp;throughout his body. He had no conscious memories&nbsp;of Shelter that were his own, so he envisioned a holograph&nbsp;of the facility that he had seen in the Jedi Archives.&nbsp;The image showed a handful of habitation modules&nbsp;clinging to the surface of an asteroid fragment, their&nbsp;domes clustered around the looming cylinder of a power&nbsp;core. In his mind's eye, Ben descended into the gaudy&nbsp;yellow docking bay at the edge of the facility . . . and&nbsp;then he was two years old again, a frightened little boy&nbsp;holding a stranger's hand as his parents departed in the&nbsp;<i>Jade Shadow.&nbsp;<br><br></i>&nbsp;An unwarranted sense of relief welled up inside Ben&nbsp;as he grew lost in a time when life had seemed so much&nbsp;easier. The last fourteen years began to feel like a long,&nbsp;terrible nightmare. Jacen's fall to the dark side had&nbsp;never happened, Ben had not been molded into an adolescent&nbsp;assassin, and his mother had not died fighting&nbsp;Jacen. All those sad memories were still just bad&nbsp;dreams, the unhappy imaginings of a frightened young&nbsp;mind.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Then the <i>Shadow </i>slipped through the containment&nbsp;field and ignited her engines. In the blink of an eye she&nbsp;dwindled from a trio of blue ion circles into a pinpoint&nbsp;of light to nothing at all, and suddenly Ben was alone&nbsp;in the darkest place in the galaxy, one child among&nbsp;dozens entrusted to a small group of worried adults&nbsp;who&#x2013;despite their cheerful voices and reassuring presences&#x2013;&nbsp;had very clammy palms and scary, anxious eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Two- year- old Ben reached toward the <i>Shadow </i>with&nbsp;his free hand and his heart, and he sensed his mother&nbsp;and father reaching back. Though he was too young to&nbsp;know he was being touched through the Force, he&nbsp;stopped being afraid . . . until a dark tentacle of need&nbsp;began to slither up into the aching tear of his abandonment.&nbsp;He thought for an instant that he was just sad&nbsp;about being left behind, but the tentacle grew as real as&nbsp;his breath, and he began to sense in it an alien loneliness&nbsp;as desperate and profound as his own. It wanted&nbsp;to draw him close and keep him safe, to take the place&nbsp;of his parents and never let him be alone again.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Terrified and confused, young Ben pulled away,&nbsp;simultaneously drawing in on himself and yanking his&nbsp;hand from the grasp of the silver- haired lady who was&nbsp;holding it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Then suddenly he was back in the cockpit of the <i>Jade&nbsp;Shadow, </i>staring into the fire- rimmed voids ahead.&nbsp;Scattered around their perimeter were the smaller&nbsp;whorls of half a dozen more distant rings, their fiery&nbsp;light burning bright and steady against the starless&nbsp;murk of the deep Maw.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;"Well?" his father asked. "Anything feel familiar?" &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Ben swallowed. He wasn't sure why, but he found&nbsp;himself wanting to withdraw from the Force all over&nbsp;again. "Are we sure we need to find these guys?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Luke raised a brow. "So it <i>is </i>familiar."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"Maybe." Ben couldn't say whether the two feelings&nbsp;were related, and at the moment he didn't care. There&nbsp;was something hungry in the Maw, something that&nbsp;would still be there waiting for him. "I mean, the Aing-&nbsp;Tii call them Mind Drinkers. That can't be good."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"Ben, you're changing the subject." Luke' s tone was&nbsp;more interested than disapproving, as though Ben's&nbsp;behavior were only one part of a much larger puzzle.&nbsp;"Is there something you don't want to talk about?" &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"I wish." Ben told his father about the dark tentacle&nbsp;that had reached out to him after the <i>Shadow </i>departed&nbsp;Shelter so many years ago. "I guess what we're feeling&nbsp;now might be related. There was definitely&nbsp;some . . . <i>thing </i>keeping tabs on me at Shelter." &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Luke considered this for a moment, then shook his&nbsp;head. "You were pretty attached to your mother.&nbsp;Maybe you were just feeling abandoned and made up a&nbsp;'friend' to take her place."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"A <i>tentacle </i>friend?"&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;"You said it was a <i>dark </i>tentacle," Luke continued&nbsp;thoughtfully, "and guilt is a dark emotion. Maybe you&nbsp;were feeling guilty about replacing us with an imaginary&nbsp;friend."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"And maybe <i>you </i>don't want to believe the tentacle&nbsp;was real because it would mean you left your two- yearold&nbsp;son someplace really dangerous," Ben countered.&nbsp;He caught his father's eye in the mirrored section again.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"I hope you're not going to try to psychoanalyze this&nbsp;away, because there's a big hole in your theory."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Luke frowned. "And that would be?"&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;"I was <i>two,</i>" Ben reminded him. "And by all accounts,&nbsp;I didn't feel guilty about <i>anything </i>at that age."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Luke grinned. "Good point, but I still don't think we&nbsp;should worry too much about this tentacle monster of&nbsp;yours."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;"It's not <i>my </i>tentacle monster," Ben retorted, miffed&nbsp;at having his concerns mocked. "You're the one who&nbsp;made me dredge it up."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Luke's expression hardened into admonishment.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;"But <i>you're </i>the one who's still afraid of it."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The observation struck home. Whether or not the&nbsp;dark presence he remembered was real, he had emerged&nbsp;from Shelter wary of abandonment and frightened of&nbsp;the Force. And it had been those fears that had allowed&nbsp;Jacen to lead him into darkness.&nbsp;<br><br>Ben sighed. "Right. Whatever this thing is, I've got to&nbsp;face it." After a moment, he asked, "So how do we find&nbsp;these Mind Drinkers?"&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;" 'The Path of True Enlightenment runs through the&nbsp;Chasm of Perfect Darkness.' " Luke was quoting&nbsp;Tadar'Ro, the Aing- Tii monk who had told them that&nbsp;Jacen had left the Kathol Rift to search out the Mind&nbsp;Drinkers. " 'The way is narrow and treacherous, but if&nbsp;you can follow it, you will find what you seek.' "&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Ben swung his gaze toward the black holes ahead. The&nbsp;brilliant whorls of their accretion disks were burning&nbsp;hottest and brightest along their inner rims, where a mixture&nbsp;of in- falling gas and dust was being compressed to&nbsp;unimaginable densities as it vanished into the sharpedged&nbsp;darkness of twin event horizons.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"Wait. Tadar'Ro said <i>perfect </i>darkness, right?" Ben&nbsp;started to have a bad feeling about the monk's instructions.&nbsp;"Like, beyond an event horizon?"&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;"Actually, it' s probably very bright on the way down&nbsp;a black hole," Luke pointed out. "Just because gravity&nbsp;is too strong for light to escape doesn't mean it can't&nbsp;exist, and there' s all that gas compressing and glowing&nbsp;as it's sucked deeper and deeper."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;"Yeah, but you're <i>dead,</i>" Ben said, "and everything&nbsp;is dark when you're dead. Still, I see what you mean. I&nbsp;doubt Tadar'Ro expects us to fly down a black hole."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"No, not <i>down </i>one."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;There was just enough anxiety in Luke's voice to&nbsp;make Ben glance into the mirrored section again. His&nbsp;father was frowning out at the two black holes, staring&nbsp;into the fiery cloud between them and looking just&nbsp;worried enough to twist Ben's stomach into a cold&nbsp;knot.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;"<i>Between </i>them?" Ben could see what his father was&nbsp;thinking, and it didn't make him happy. In any system&nbsp;of two large bodies, there were five areas where the&nbsp;centrifugal and gravitational forces would neutralize&nbsp;each other and hold a smaller body&#x2013;such as a satellite&nbsp;or asteroid&#x2013;in perpetual equilibrium. Of those five&nbsp;locations, only one was directly <i>between </i>the two bodies.&nbsp;"You mean Stable Zone One?"&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Luke nodded. "The Chasm of Perfect Darkness is an&nbsp;ancient Ashla parable referring to the twin perils of ego&nbsp;and ignorance," he explained. "The Tythonians spoke&nbsp;of it as a deep dark canyon flanked by high, evercrumbling&nbsp;cliffs."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"So life is the chasm, darkness is falling all around,"&nbsp;Ben said, taking an educated guess as to the parable's&nbsp;meaning, "and the only way to stay in the light is to go&nbsp;down the middle."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Luke smiled. "You've got a real feeling for mystic&nbsp;guidance." He lifted his hands away from the yoke.&nbsp;"You have the ship, son."&nbsp;<br><br><i>&nbsp;"Me? Now?" </i>Ben considered pointing out that his&nbsp;father was by far the better pilot&#x2013;but that wasn' t the&nbsp;issue, of course. If Ben was going to face his fears, he&nbsp;needed to handle the flying himself. He swallowed&nbsp;hard, squared his shoulders, then confirmed, "I have&nbsp;the ship."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Ben deactivated the mirror panel and accelerated&nbsp;toward the black holes. As the <i>Shadow </i>drew closer,&nbsp;their dark orbs rapidly began to swell and drift toward&nbsp;opposite sides of the cockpit, until all that could be seen&nbsp;of them were tall slivers of darkness hanging along the&nbsp;rear edges of the canopy. Ahead lay a fiery confluence&nbsp;of superheated gas, swirling in from two different directions&nbsp;and so bright it hurt Ben's eyes even through the&nbsp;<i>Shadow</i>'s blast- tinting.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;He checked the primary display and found only&nbsp;bright static; the navigation sensors were awash in electromagnetic&nbsp;blast from compressing gas. The <i>Shadow</i>'s&nbsp;internal sensors were working just fine, however, and&nbsp;they showed the ship's hull temperature rising rapidly&nbsp;as they penetrated the cloud. It wouldn't take long for&nbsp;that to become dangerous, Ben knew. Soon the fierce&nbsp;heat inside the accretion disk would start fouling guidance&nbsp;systems and control relays. Eventually, it would&nbsp;compromise hull integrity.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;"Dad, how about doing something with those sensor&nbsp;filters?" Ben asked. "My navigational readings are&nbsp;snow."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;"Adjusting the filters won't change anything," Luke&nbsp;said calmly. "We're flying between a pair of black holes<i>,&nbsp;</i>remember?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Ben exhaled in exasperation, then cursed under his&nbsp;breath and continued to stare out into the fiery ribbons&nbsp;ahead. At best, he could make out a confluence zone&nbsp;where the two accretion disks were brushing against&nbsp;each other, and the painful brilliance made it dif...</p><h2>John: 90 Days with the Beloved Disciple (Personal Reflections)</h2><p><p>Best-selling author Beth Moore has a remarkable gift for crafting insightful Bible character studies.

The Rapture Verdict is likely to become one of the most controversial Christian books in decades, and it addresses many of the hottest questions being debated today... -Will Christians have to go through all of the chaos described in the book of Revelation? -Is the judgment of God coming to America? -Are we on the verge of entering the Great Tribulation? -What is &#34;the parousia&#34;, and how does that ancient Greek word completely shake up conventional theories about the rapture? -Does the rapture come before, after or somewhere in the middle of the Tribulation? -Why are millions of Christians in the western world going to become extremely angry with their pastors? -Do the Biblical festivals provide us with a prophetic template for the events surrounding the second coming of Jesus Christ? -Will this be the generation that witnesses the rise of the Antichrist and the Mark of the Beast? -Is the organized church in danger of missing out on the greatest move of God the world has ever seen? Michael Snyder answers those questions along with so many others in an uncompromising manner. The amazing discoveries and ominous warnings that he shares in this book are going to shake the Christian world to the core. The Rapture Verdict is both a chilling warning and a deeply inspiring message of hope.

While she and her lover Allan Quatermain have achieved a measure of eternal youth, recruiting new talents such as the trans-gendered immortal Orlando, the ghost-finder Thomas Carnacki and the gentleman thief A.J. Raffles to replace their deceased or missing colleagues, former associate Captain Nemo has retired to his Pacific pirate island to decline in surly isolation.

From the occult parlours and crime-haunted wharfs of 1910, through the criminal, mystical and psychedelic underworlds of 1969 to the financially and culturally desolated streets of 2009, the disintegrating remnants of Miss Murray and her League must combat not only the hidden hand of their undying adversary, but also the ethical and psychological collapse accompanying this new era.

On Saturdays, she visits Grandma and Grandpa, who come from a European-American background, and on Sundays -- <i>los domingos --</i> she visits <i>Abuelito y Abuelita,</i> who are Mexican-American. While the two sets of grandparents are different in many ways, they also have a great deal in common -- in particular, their love for their granddaughter. <br> While we follow our narrator to the circus and the pier, share stories from her grandparents' pasts, and celebrate her birthday, the depth and joy of both cultures are conveyed in Spanish and English.

It wasapparent that they had very mixed heritage-Chinese, Japanese, Filipino,Hawaiian, Puerto Rican, Anglo- and that they felt very comfortable witheach other. That experience moved me to write this story. It took a long time for the book to be published and by then I did have grandchildrenwith dual heritage.

It is a fundamental element of the human condition. It's the key to giving schoolchildren skills they need to succeed--skills like creativity, innovation, teamwork, focus, resilience, expressiveness, empathy, concentration, and executive function. Expert organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Academy of Sciences, and the Centers for Disease Control agree that play and physical activity are critical foundations of childhood, academics, and future skills--yet politicians are destroying play in childhood education and replacing it with standardization, stress, and forcible physical restraint, which are damaging to learning and corrosive to society. <br><br>But this is not the case for hundreds of thousands of lucky children who are enjoying the power of play in schools in China, Texas, Oklahoma, Long Island, Scotland, and in the entire nation of Finland. In <em>Let the Children Play</em>, Pasi Sahlberg, Finnish educator and scholar, and Fulbright Scholar William Doyle make the case for helping schools and children thrive by unleashing the power of play and giving more physical and intellectual play to all schoolchildren. <br><br>In the course of writing this book, Sahlberg and Doyle traveled worldwide, reviewed over 700 research studies, and conducted interviews with over 50 of the world's leading authorities on education. Most intriguingly,<em> Let the Children Play</em> provides a glimpse into the play-based experiments ongoing now all over the world, from rural China, Singapore, and Scotland to North Texas and Oklahoma, as well as the promising results of these bold new approaches. Readers will find the book to be both a call for change and a guide for making that change happen in their own communities.<br></p><p><br><strong>Pasi Sahlberg</strong> is Professor of Education Policy at Gonski Institute for Education, University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.

Adding play back into children's hurried and stressed lives might just be the elixir that will help them thrive in a workforce of thinkers, innovators, and collaborators. Thank you Doyle and Sahlberg for giving us a road map so that we can put our educational systems back on course." -- <strong>Kathy Hirsh-Pasek</strong>, Lefkowitz Faculty Fellow in Psychology at Temple University<p></p><br>"Sahlberg and Doyle whack us in the head with the reality that 21st Century skills require old-fashioned learning as children. Play is the analog of life - observing the world, identifying challenges, taking risks, failing, problem-solving again and again, struggling to find consensus with others, absorbing defeats with grace and celebrating victories with exuberance. What builds successful adults is the ability to rise undaunted to opportunities, build relationships, feed curiosity and seize the joy that is at the heart of learning and of living!" -- <strong>Michael Rich</strong>, Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and author of <em>Ask the Mediatrician</em><p></p><br>"<em>Let the Children Play</em> should be in the hands of every single teacher, parent and policy maker who touch the lives of the children they serve. Sahlberg and Doyle clearly articulate and demand that we wake up and finally acknowledge that children have the fundamental right to play in school. This is a compelling vision of the power of play and what we can do to ensure it comes off the 'endangered species' list and back into every school around the world." -- <strong>Michael J. Hynes, Ed.D.</strong>, Superintendent of Schools for the Patchogue-Medford School District in New York<p></p><br>"<em>Let the Children Play</em> is a passionate, eloquent and substantiated argument for a radical change of priorities in how many parents, educators and policymakers provide for the education, health and well being of children." -- from the Foreword by <strong>Sir Ken Robinson</strong><p></p><br>"We have undervalued the role of play in school to our own detriment as educators, and that of our students. In a culture where standardized testing has crowded out inquisitiveness and play, our students don't get an opportunity to tinker and experiment without high stakes judgments. Without play, teachers don't get to learn from watching their students be unbound by their inner creative selves. When children play, we observe the possibility of their imagination, and retool our structured classroom learning to create activities that model the authentic play and joy of students. It's a missed opportunity to learn from a feedback loop on what comes naturally to children. Play can liberate the power of inquiry in classrooms, that ironically can produce better test scores. Kudos for being so bold with this book!" -- <strong>Eric Contreras</strong>, Principal, Stuyvesant High School, New York City<p></p><br>"Play develops our imagination and capacity to collaborate and is what makes us human. Sahlberg and Doyle have written a brilliant and compelling manifesto for bringing play back into the lives of children. Let the revolution begin!" -- <strong>Tony Wagner</strong>, best-selling author of <em>The Global Achievement Gap</em> and <em>Creating Innovators</em>.<p></p><br>"Insightful... An excellent offering for parent activists, education students, and school administrators."--<em>Library Journal</em> <br><p></p><br>"The book convincingly shows the reader that all children deserve to grow physically, emotionally, academically and socially--the benefits of real play nurture the soul as well as the development of the whole child. What's more important than that?" <br>--<em>School Administrator Magazine</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Social Entrepreneurship: What Everyone Needs to Know�</h2><p>In development circles, there is now widespread consensus that social entrepreneurs represent a far better mechanism to respond to needs than we have ever had before--a decentralized and emergent force that remains our best hope for solutions that can keep pace with our problems and create a more peaceful world. <br><br>David Bornstein's previous book on social entrepreneurship, <em>How to Change the World</em>, was hailed by Nicholas Kristof in the <em>New York Times</em> as "a bible in the field" and published in more than twenty countries. Now, Bornstein shifts the focus from the profiles of successful social innovators in that book--and teams with Susan Davis, a founding board member of the Grameen Foundation--to offer the first general overview of social entrepreneurship. In a Q &amp; A format allowing readers to go directly to the information they need, the authors map out social entrepreneurship in its broadest terms as well as in its particulars.<br><br>Bornstein and Davis explain what social entrepreneurs are, how their organizations function, and what challenges they face. The book will give readers an understanding of what differentiates social entrepreneurship from standard business ventures and how it differs from traditional grant-based non-profit work. Unlike the typical top-down, model-based approach to solving problems employed by the World Bank and other large institutions, social entrepreneurs work through a process of iterative learning -- learning by doing--working with communities to find unique, local solutions to unique, local problems. Most importantly, the book shows readers exactly how they can get involved. <br><br>Anyone inspired by Barack Obama's call to service and who wants to learn more about the essential features and enormous promise of this new method of social change, <em>Social Entrepreneurship: What Everyone Needs to Know</em> is the ideal first place to look.<br><br><em>What Everyone Needs to Know</em> is a registered trademark of Oxford University Press.<br></p><p><p><b><em>WHAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO KNOW About This Series</em></b></p> <p><b>Who it's for:</b></p> <p> Busy people with diverse interests, ranging from college students to professionals, who wish to inform themselves in a succinct yet authoritative manner about a particular topic.</p> <p><b>What's inside:</b></p> <p>An incisive approach to a complex and timely issue, laid out in a straight-forward, question-and-answer format.</p> <p><b>Meet Our Authors</b></p> <p> Top experts in their given fields, ranging from an <i>Economist</i> correspondent to a director at the Council on Foreign Relations, you can trust our authors&#x2019; expertise and guidance.</p> <p><b>Popular Topics in the "<i>What Everyone Needs to Know</i>" Series</b></p> <ul> <li>International Politics</li> <li>Environmental Policies</li> <li>World History</li> <li>Sciences &amp; Math</li> <li>Religion &amp; Spirituality</li> </ul><br><strong>David Bornstein</strong> specializes in writing about social innovation.

Only this time Kara is magicless without her grimoire and Sordyr, the forest demon, is intent on keeping them there. Kara and Taff will meet other inhabitants of the Thickety in their search for a safe way out, including the infamous witch, Mary Kettle. But can they trust anyone&#x2014;plant, creature, witch, book, or magic&#x2014;to help them escape, to undo Grace's final terrible spell, and to stop Sordyr's horrible reach from spreading across the rest of the world?</p><p>Correlates to the Common Core State Standards in English Language Arts</p></p><p><p><em>The Thickety is no place to be alone. </em></p><p>The branches closed behind Kara and Taff when they rode Shadowdancer into the dark forest. But there is no returning to the village, and Sordyr chases close behind. The forest demon has a terrible plan&#x2014;one that requires Kara's magic to succeed.</p><p>The dangers of the Thickety are many. Its plants are often deadly, strange animals whisper among the trees, and unknown magic lurks behind every twist and shadow of the path. But more dangerous still are the other inhabitants of the Thickety: Sordyr and his snapping branchwolves; the shadowy residents of an abandoned village; and Imogen, a creature with an unspeakable hunger.</p><p><em>They would do anything she asked.<br>All she had to do was use her magic. </em></p><p>And then there's Mary Kettle, a strange witch seeking redemption from a horrifying past. She offers to lead them out of the Thickety while teaching Kara how to cast spells without a grimoire. The children are hesitant to trust her . . . but this could be their only chance to escape.</p><p>Or the first step down a dark and wicked path.</p><p>J. A. White is the author of <em>The Thickety: A Path Begins</em>. He lives in New Jersey with his wife, three sons, and a hamster named Ophelia that doesn't like him very much. When he's not making up stories, he teaches a bunch of kids how to make up stories (along with math and science and other important stuff).

Made specifically for the small screen, within the tight constraints of broadcasting standards, what these humble movies lacked in budget and star appeal, they made up for in other ways. Often they served as an introduction to genre films, particularly horror, mirroring their theatrical counterparts with a focus on sinister cults, women in prison, haunted houses and even animals in revolt. They were also a place to address serious contemporary issues �&#x20ac;&#x201c; drugs, prostitution, sexual violence and justice �&#x20ac;&#x201c;albeit in a cosy domestic environment. <br><br>Production of telefilms continues to this day, but their significance within the history of mass media remains under-discussed. Are You in the House Alone? seeks to address this imbalance in a series of reviews and essays by fans and critics. It looks at many of the films, the networks and names behind them, and also specific genres �&#x20ac;&#x201c; everything from Stephen King adaptations to superheroes to true-life dramas. So, kickback and crack open the TV guide once more for the event that is the Movie of the Week!</p><p>Amanda Reyes is a freelance writer and podcaster who focuses on the made for television movie genre, with her blog Made for TV Mayhem and its companion podcast.

Although this concept has ancient roots in mythology, folklore, and fairy tales, it continues to resonate today within modern culture. McIntosh leads readers, chapter by chapter, through the magical and spiritual history of the North, as well as its modern manifestations, as documented through physical records, such as runestones and megaliths, but also through mythology and lore.</p><p>This mythic conception of a unique, powerful, and mysterious Northern civilization was known to the Greeks as "Hyberborea"--the "Land Beyond the North Wind"--which they considered to be the true origin place of their god, Apollo, bringer of civilization. Through the Greeks, this concept of the mythic North would spread throughout Western civilization.</p><p>In addition, McIntosh discusses Russian Hyperboreanism, which he describes as among "the most influential of the new religions and quasi-religious movements that have sprung up in Russia since the fall of Communism" and which is currently almost unknown in the West.</p></p><p><b>Christopher McIntosh</b> is a writer and historian specializing in the esoteric traditions of the West. He was for several years on the faculty of the Centre for the Study of Esotericism at Exeter University. He lives in Bremen, Germany. <br><b>Hilmar �rn Hilmarsson</b> is the Allsherjargo�i (high priest) of the �satru community of Iceland. He is an internationally celebrated musician and a composer of film music, who has written the scores for such films as Children of Nature, Cold Fever, and In the Cut.&#x201c;This is an amazing and deeply original book; a work of immense erudition written in an elegant, approachable, and luminously intelligible style. Its quiet wit tempers its awe-inspiring and sometimes terrifying perspectives. I have been educated and delighted by this book.&#x201d; --<b>Frederick Turner</b>, Founders Professor of Arts and Humanities, University of Texas at Dallas (Frederick Turner)<br><br>"Like the runes he explores, Christopher McIntosh&#x2019;s use of language contains &#x2018;capsules of magical power&#x2019;. His shamanistic journey to Hyperborea leads the reader through myths, place names, folk tales, star lore, and intriguing and outlandish archaeological traces. In&nbsp;<i>Beyond the North Wind,</i>&nbsp;McIntosh takes us back in time to a civilization older than Atlantis and called the origin of all primal tradition. He also shows how in another dimension Hyperborea never went away, how it is still a root of primal forces, giving individuals in politics and the arts a sense of energy and power - for good or for ill." &#x2013;<b>Mark Booth</b>, author of&nbsp;<i>The Secret History of the World</i> (Mark Booth)<br><br>"<i>Beyond the North Wind</i> is a masterful example of academic detective work, leading to the astounding conclusion that our Arctic northlands were once home to a lost prehistoric civilization. Highly recommended." &#x2014;<b>Herbie Brennan</b>, author of <i>The Atlantis Enigma</i> (Herbie Brennan)<br><br>"Among many other things, Christopher McIntosh&#x2019;s book deals with the fascinating topic of Hyperborea, the legendary northern homeland, lying somewhere beyond the Arctic Circle, a source of ancient wisdom and advanced knowledge, lost to humanity. This mysterious land has captured the imagination of many esotericists, artists. and explorers, especially those in Russia, seeking to solve one of the world&#x2019;s greatest mysteries. Based on a variety of documentary sources and beautifully written, <i>Beyond the North Wind</i> makes compelling reading." --<b>Alexander Andreyev</b>, Russian historian, Tibetologist. and philologist, author of <i>The Myth of the Masters: The Occult Lives of Nikolai and Helena Roerich</i> and <i>Occultist of the Land of the Soviets: The Mystery of Dr. Barchenko</i> (Alexander Andreyev)<br><br>"In <i>Beyond the North Wind</i>, Christopher McIntosh takes us on a journey to explore all the profound cultural history and nuances of Hyperborea in the European heritage, expertly guiding us to understand the Northern Mysteries of Paganism in new and deeper ways. Numerous important historical figures and traditions and all manner of ancient ideas are here, presented in an engaging way. If you're interested in finding your spiritual North, read this book!" &#x2014;<b>Arthur Versluis</b>, author of <i>Entering the Mysteries: The Secret Traditions of Indigenous Europe</i> and <i>The Secret Island</i> (Arthur Versluis)<br><br>"<i>Beyond the North Wind</i> is important and deserves celebration for the profound, but until now hidden truth it contains suggesting a Nordic origin of civilization, backed up by solid research in archaeology. Both esoteric scholars and educated Heathens will find it of inestimable value. This tantalizing tapestry of hard factual evidence of the Hyperborean hypothesis is allied by deep metaphysics and mythology. The book contains a wealth of information from Russia, not seen before in the West, to my knowledge, as well as an extensive appendix listing gods and other beings from Norse mythology. Fascinating and pleasant to read." --<b>Freya Aswynn</b>, author of <i>Northern Mysteries</i> and <i>Magick and Leaves of Yggdrasil</i> (Freya Aswynn)<br><br>"Christopher McIntosh&#x2019;s new book on the history, mythology and meaning of actual and supposed Hyperborean civilizations provided me with a captivating adventure, akin to setting sail in a Nordic longboat into formerly icy and uncharted territory. As the journey progressed, my mind began to un-freeze as I was opened to the author&#x2019;s fabulous array of scholarly lore amid a fascinating range of vital research upon topics many of us have gained only hints about in the past. This is an invigorating, important work to appear as many people seek meaningful identities within, and perhaps beyond, a modern world that is fast divorcing people from their roots and their souls. Dr McIntosh cuts through the ice with a diamond edge, revealing a lake of insight and promise of greater, more enriching vistas to come. I commend this work highly both to fellow scholars and to anyone seriously interested in the highly charged meaning of the word &#x201c;Nordic&#x201d;, a word rightly associated with quality, nobility, and beauty, only abused by those who lack those very qualities. Dr McIntosh&#x2019;s genial text is consistently illuminating, easy to read and digest, scholarly but by no means dry or obscure. He wants to communicate his knowledge and interest, clearly and fairly, and succeeds wonderfully in a work representing the achievements of a lifetime of open-hearted study and valid experience." --<b>Tobias Churton</b>, author of <i>The True History of the Rosicrucians, Aleister Crowley: The Biography, Jerusalem! The Real Life of William Blake</i>; <i>Occult Paris</i>, and <i>The Spiritual Meaning of the Sixties</i> (Tobias Churton)<br><br>"Unique among scholars, Christopher McIntosh knows Iceland and the leaders of its Pagan revival; Russia, with its new wave of art and literature; and the popular genres of folk music, fiction and film. All this is backed by a profound knowledge of Western esoteric traditions. In his new book <i>Beyond the North Wind</i>, he not only chronicles the rise of the Northern egregore but contributes his own loyalty and learning to it. He argues persuasively for the reality of Hyperborea as a prehistoric circumpolar culture, and for the perennial value of its legacy." --<b>Joscelyn Godwin</b>, author of <i>ARKTOS: The Polar Myth in Science, Symbolism, &amp; Nazi Survival, The Pagan Dream of the Renaissance</i>, and many other books (Joscelyn Godwin)<br><br>"The North is back with a vengeance. So says Christopher McIntosh in his latest book, <i>Beyond the North Wind: The Fall and Rise of the Mystic North</i>. In a mixture of scholarly research, historical evidence, archaeological findings and speculative musings, the author invites the reader on an adventure of exploration to find the truth about a &#x2018;mysterious, advanced, prehistoric culture in the North.&#x2019; The North has long been considered barbaric and primitive. We have been taught that culture moved from the south to the north, despite much historical and archaeological evidence to the contrary. Have we been blinded by popular dogma? Did Hyperborea actually exist? What if a superior civilization did exist in the circumpolar regions and it moved south leaving its mark on culture, language, science, math and religion in all parts of the world? What if we have actually degenerated rather than advanced? What if enlightenment came from the North? I would definitely recommend this book." --<b>Ingrid Kincaid</b>, author of <i>The Runes Revealed</i> (Ingrid Kincaid)</p><h2>A History of the Episcopal Church - Third Revised Edition: Complete through the 78th General Convention</h2><p>This thorough, carefully researched history sets church events against the background of social changes.

From THE WHORE OF MENSA, to GOD (A Play), to NO KADDISH FOR WEINSTEIN, old and new Woody Allen fans will laugh themselves hysterical over these sparkling gems.</p><p>The title of Woody Allen's second collection of <i>New Yorker</i>-style sprint humor is a sly comment on Emily Dickinson's famous quote, "Hope is the thing with feathers." <i>Without Feathers</i> delivers Allen's hopeless schlub persona--you remember, what he used to be before he was either a lecher or an <i>auteur</i>, depending on your politics. In addition to being as funny as anything published since, to read <i>Without Feathers</i> is to return to a simpler time, when being a fan of his work was common, not controversial.<p> Though each piece is funny, two of them are particularly notable examples of Allen's distinctive style (borrowed in large part from S.J. Perelman by way of the Borscht Belt, but distinctive, nevertheless)--"The Whore of Mensa" and "If the Impressionists Had Been Dentists." Here's an excerpt from the latter: </p><blockquote> Mrs. Sol Schwimmer is suing me because I made her bridge as I felt it and not to fit her ridiculous mouth! That's right! I can't work to order like a common tradesman! I decided her bridge should be enormous and billowing, with wild, explosive teeth flaring up in every direction like fire! Now she is upset because it won't fit in her mouth! She is so bourgeois and stupid, I want to smash her! I tried forcing the false plate in but it sticks out like a star burst chandelier. </blockquote> <i>Without Feathers</i> is fine, funny prose, from an American master. If you're a fan, seek it out immediately. It's a document from the days when Woody was not important, but merely hysterically funny. <i>--Michael Gerber</i><b>Woody Allen</b>&#x2019;s prolific career as a comic, writer, and filmmaker has now spanned more than six decades. He writes frequently for&nbsp;<i>The New Yorker</i>&nbsp;and is the author of&nbsp;<i>Without Feathers, Getting Even,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Side Effects</i>, among other books.</p><h2>Toad on the Road: A Cautionary Tale</h2><p><p>With bouncy call-and-response text and vivid illustrations, this lively picture book from author-illustrator Stephen Shaskan is sure to have readers giggling along with Toad's silly antics.

He lives in Minneapolis with his wife, Trisha Speed Shaskan, and their cat, Eartha, and dog, Bea.</p>PreS-Gr 1&#x2014;Toad sits in the middle of the road, playing with his friend, a fly, when along comes Bear on a bike. "Everyone shout: Look out! Look out!" Bear crashes with a loud "Skid! Screech! Bam!" He warns the young toad that a road is no place to play. "Vamoose! Skedaddle! Without delay!/What do you think your mama would say?" Croc in a car and Vole in a van follow the same pattern as Bear, creating a pileup of wrecked vehicles. When Mama Toad arrives in her tow truck, one wonders if she's worried for her baby's safety or if the situation was designed to drum up some towing business for her. The digital art is attractive, but the high-energy text dominates. Sets of rhythmic, rhyming phrases are repeated throughout, allowing children to join in on the telling. As each new animal is introduced, it is first shown in silhouette, giving kids the opportunity to guess what it is.

The classic spy novel was essentially a story of good (England, the United States) vs. evil (Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union), in which good more or less prevailed. <i>The Tailor of Panama</i> is something else entirely: a spy novel with no spies in which the bad guys reap most of the rewards. It is also a viciously funny satire. The novel is set in Panama, where a plot is in place to make void the Panama Treaty, which would return control of the Panama Canal to the Panamanians in 1999. At the center of events is Harry Pendel, the tailor of the title. Coerced into working for British Intelligence, he concocts out of whole cloth a left-wing movement with the goal of luring the American military to do the dirty work--invade Panama � la 1989 and nullify the treaty. From the characters to the setting, le Carr� has succeeded in setting new parameters for an old genre.11 cds</p><h2>Lift The Flap Telling The Time</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p></p><h2>False Impression</h2><p><p>Why was an elegant lady BRUTALLY MURDERED the night before 9/11?</p><p>Why was a successful New York banker not surprised to receive A WOMAN'S LEFT EAR in the mail?</p><p>Why did a young woman with a brilliant career steal an IMPRESSIONIST PAINTING?</p><p>Why was an honors graduate working as a temporary secretary after INHERITING A FORTUNE?</p><p>Why was a SENIOR FBI AGENT trying to work out the connection between these four apparently innocent individuals?</p><p>A breathtaking journey of twists and turns from New York to London, from Bucharest and on to Tokyo ends up in a sleepy English village where the mystery surrounding Van Gogh's last painting will finally be resolved.</p><p><b>This edition of the book is the deluxe, tall rack mass market paperback.</b></p></p><p><p>Why was an elegant lady brutally murdered the night before 9/11? <br> <br>Why was a successful New York banker not surprised to receive a woman&#x2019;s left ear in the morning mail?<br> <br>Why did a top Manhattan lawyer work only for one client, but never charge a fee?<br> <br>Why did a young woman with a bright career steal a priceless Van Gogh painting? <br>Why was an Olympic gymnast paid a million dollars an assignment when she didn&#x2019;t have a bank account? <br> <br>Why was an honors graduate working as a temporary secretary after inheriting a fortune? <br> <br>Why was an English Countess ready to kill the banker, the lawyer and the gymnast even if it meant spending the rest of her life in jail? <br> <br>Why was a Japanese steel magnate happy to hand over $50,000,000 to a woman he had only met once? <br> <br>Why was a senior FBI agent trying to work out the connection between these eight apparently innocent individuals? <br> <br>All these questions are answered in Jeffrey Archer&#x2019;s latest novel, <em>False Impression</em>, but not before a breathtaking journey of twists and turns that will take readers from New York to London to Bucharest and on to Tokyo, and finally a sleepy English village, where the mystery of Van Gogh&#x2019;s last painting will finally be resolved. <br> <br>And only then will readers discover that Van Gogh&#x2019;s <em>Self-portrait with Bandaged Ear</em> has a secret of its own that acts as the final twist in this unforgettable yarn.</p><p><b>The theft of a priceless Van Gogh ignites a chase across the globe in Jeffrey Archer's latest international bestselling thriller</b><br><b> </b><br><b><i>FALSE IMPRESSION</i></b><br><b> </b><br><b></b>Why was an elegant lady BRUTALLY MURDERED the night before 9/11?</p><p>Why was a successful New York banker not surprised to receive A WOMAN'S LEFT EAR in the mail?</p><p>Why did a young woman with a brilliant career steal an IMPRESSIONIST PAINTING?</p><p>Why was an honors graduate working as a temporary secretary after INHERITING A FORTUNE?</p><p>Why was a SENIOR FBI AGENT trying to work out the connection between these four apparently innocent individuals?</p><p>A breathtaking journey of twists and turns from New York to London, from Bucharest and on to Tokyo ends up in a sleepy English village where the mystery surrounding Van Gogh's last painting will finally be resolved.</p></p><h2>Rusty (The Puppy Place #54)</h2><p><b>Welcome to the Puppy Place -- where every puppy finds a home!</b><br><br>Lizzie is so ready for animal camp at the Caring Paws Shelter during her school vacation.

His first cookbook On the Side was published in spring 2017 to great acclaim.Borough Market has played an important role in the development of British food culture. By allowing a relationship to develop between citizens and food producers, its rise has marked a new beginning for British production. Going into the Market means meeting the producers, talking to them, hearing their stories. It is a place that offers so much: <b>history, integrity, wonderful food</b> and the chance to really understand what you're eating. By respecting tradition, promoting sustainability and revelling in the love of good food, Borough Market provides a true representation of the philosophy of Slow Food.&#x2015;<b><i>Carlo Petrini, founder and president of Slow Food</i></b><br><br>Borough is one of the great European food markets, sitting proudly alongside La Boqueria in Barcelona, Testaccio in Rome and Cours Saleya in Nice. I always get a thrill when I visit, whether it's to grab an armful of puntarelle or to indulge in a Kappacasein melted cheese sandwich. <i>The Borough Market Cookbook</i> brings that excitement to life with a <b>remarkable chronicle</b> of the market's origins a thousand years ago to its renaissance in the 1990s.

After one keynote I was asked for a non-technical guide to understand blockchains. This is it.</p><p> The book aims to help you get your head around blockchains in general and around Ethereum specifically. Since Ethereum is currently the pre-imminent blockchain, it makes sense as reference point. The essential stuff is the same for any blockchain.</p><p> This text was written for people with a fast grasp, who are not programmers. Reading this should give you the basics to cut through the hype and to identify blockchain opportunities in your professional domain. There are tiny bits of code, which can be admired and skipped.</p><p> We�ll look at Ethereum�s benefits first, how it is used and what can be done with it; then explain blockchain machinery, visiting the terms that you�ll be confronted with in every discussion about its application. Exactly what you need to tell the signal from the noise in the echo chamber of honest misunderstandings and desperate marketing.</p><p> We take a good hard look at limitations, throw in some history and names and give a realistic outlook.</p><p> The index reads like an FAQ and you can use the book like that. However, there is a strong build up, one chapter leading to the next, as optimized path to understanding all the interconnected, moving parts. There�s quite a number of them.</p><p> Blockchains are not a trivial topic. The fact that blockchain client programs are small has fooled many people into believing it can�t possibly be that hard. The challenges are in the implications though.</p><p> But what&#x2019;s in this book will put you ahead of almost everyone outside the core bubble.</p><p> A deep dive into this field now &#x2013; at least getting started &#x2013; will help you to become part of the fun ahead. It should allow you to stand out, land deals or a great job.</p><p> It will also make you see first hand how early we are in the game.</p><p> Hopefully, we will find a contributor to the blockchain community in you, strengthening the portfolio of real-world use cases. Ideally, you�ll learn to navigate your own uncharted course through your domain and revolutionize it.</p><p> </p><p> <b>From the Book&#x2019;s Index:</b></p><p> What is Ethereum?<br> What is Ether?<br> What is Ethereum Not?<br> What is Ethereum Used for?<br> Create Your Own Digital Currency!<br> How Does Ethereum Compare?<br> How Does Ethereum Work?<br> <br> What is a Blockchain?<br> What is Cryptography?<br> What�s the Magic?<br> What is Holding It Back?<br> What is a Cryptocurrency?<br> What is a Digital Currency?<br> What is a Digital Asset?<br> What is a Mirror Asset?<br> What is Consensus?<br> What is Proof&#x2013;of&#x2013;Work?<br> What is Proof&#x2013;of&#x2013;Stake?<br> What is a Hard&#x2013;Fork?<br> What is Mining?<br> What is Decentralized Code?<br> What is a Decentralized Application (Dapp)?<br> What is a Smart Contract?<br> What is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)?<br> What is an Oracle?<br> What is Timestamping?<br> What is a Private Chain?<br> What is the EVM?<br> What is Gas?<br> What is Solidity?<br> <br> How Fast is Ethereum / Latency?<br> What is Ethereum�s Capacity / Throughput?<br> What is Probabilistic Finality?<br> How Ready is Ethereum?<br> Is Ethereum Legal?<br> <br> How did Bitcoin Start?<br> What&#x2019;s the Story Behind Ethereum?<br> What is The DAO?<br> What is Ethereum Classic?<br> What is all the Hype about?<br> What&#x2019;s the Future?<br> Will Ethereum Change the World?<br> <br> APPENDIX with technical notes<br> Hello, World!<br> Installation<br> Clients<br> </p><p> Drafts of the book have been run by core Ethereum people and highest ranking IBM engineers in a bid to ensure accuracy.</p><p> I&#x2019;ll be happy to hear what you felt was missing or presented out of order, no matter your background.</p><p> Opinions in this book are mine, not that of IBM. </p><p> I am not an Ethereum spokesperson either.</p><p></p></p><p><p>Henning Diedrich has been called IBM's most knowledgeable guy in blockchain, and a thought leader in this field.</p> <p>He was named architect at the IBM blockchain group, writing the first white paper for IBM's Open Blockchain project and is the official IBM liaison to the Ethereum Foundation's core development teams, helping to harden Ethereum for industrial use.</p> <p>Henning frequently gives deeply technical presentations as well as highly inspirational keynotes on blockchain topics around the world.

In essence, it is simply the art of being aware of what is going on inside and around us. As we acquire the knack, meditation can be our companion wherever we are&#x2015;at work, at play, at rest.</p><p><i>Meditation</i> contains practical, step-by-step guides to a wide variety of meditation techniques selected by and/or created by Osho, including the unique OSHO Active Meditations which deal with the special tensions of contemporary life. Recognizing that it&#x2019;s almost impossible for most people these days just to stop and sit silently, these meditations&#x2015;including the Osho Dynamic Meditation and Osho Kundalini Meditation&#x2015;begin with one or more stages of vigorous physical activity. This brings our physical and mental energies to a peak, so that the following silence is easy&#x2015;leaving us alert, refreshed, and newly energized.</p><p>Newly revised and resized into a handy portable format, Meditation is the perfect text to begin or continue exploring the joys of meditation.</p><p><b>Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described by the <i>Sunday Times</i> of London as one of the &#x201c;1000 Makers of the 20th Century&#x201d; and by <i>Sunday Mid-Day</i> (India) as one of the ten people&#x2015;along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha&#x2015;who have changed the destiny of India. Since his death in 1990, the influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world.</b></p></p><p><p>"In Buddha's time, dynamic methods of meditation were not needed. People were more simple, more authentic. Now, people are living a very repressed life, a very unreal life. Just sitting directly in silence won't help." - Osho</p><p><b>Osho</b> is one of the most provocative and inspiring spiritual teachers of the twentieth century. Known for his revolutionary contribution to the science of inner transformation, the influence of his teachings continues to grow, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world.

What if there's something about anxiety that can be used for you instead of against you?</p><p>In this revolutionary new book, Dr. Alicia H. Clark recognizes anxiety as an unsung hero in the path to success and well-being. Anxiety is a powerful motivating force that can be harnessed to create a better you, if you've got the right tools. <em>Hack Your Anxiety</em> provides a road map to approach anxiety in a new &#x2015;and empowering &#x2015; light.</p><p>Weaving together modern neuroscience, case studies, interviews, and personal anecdotes, <em>Hack Your Anxiety </em>demonstrates how anxiety can be reclaimed as a potent force for living our best lives.</p></p><p>Alicia H. Clark is a licensed psychologist specializing in anxiety and relationships.

Anxiety, stress, and trauma have been shown to affect all levels of our mental, physical, and spiritual health from the first days of gestation. If we are to survive in our fast-paced, information-based world, we will have to learn to domesticate our primitive fear circuitry and use our minds to change our brains. <i>Hack Your Anxiety</i> will provide you with straightforward, no-nonsense ways of hacking into this circuitry and regaining control of your brain.&#x201d; - <strong><em> Louis Cozolino, Ph.D., author of The Making of a Therapist and The Neuroscience of Psychotherapy</em></strong></p><p>&#x201c;Alicia Clark offers a refreshingly renegade perspective on anxiety. In a world where many individuals and couples are not operating out of secure functioning, and anxiety has been linked to insecure attachment, this is welcome news. In fact, research in neuroscience, especially as pertains to nervous system arousal regulation, supports the notion that it is possible to manage anxiety in a way that leads to happier, more fulfilled lives. Clark&#x2019;s book includes a helpful introduction to some basic neuroscientific principles, along with a recommended process for handling anxiety. With Clark&#x2019;s toolkit, anyone suffering from anxiety can draw new hope.&#x201d; - <strong><em> Stan Tatkin, author of Wired for Love</em></strong></p><p>&#x201c;As the medical director of The Ross Center, with three offices treating thousands of people with anxiety, I am so pleased to have a unique new resource for patients that emphasizes the positive power of our anxiety response and very clearly shows how it can be harnessed and used to our benefit. The explanation of the neurobiology behind anxiety, the case vignettes offered, and the tool kit provided are all clearly laid out such that the anxiety is understood, hope is instilled, and a change in perspective is possible. The reader is provided a clear path to taking back control of anxiety and seeing it as an incredibly useful tool to help them along the path toward self-fulfillment. Thank you, Alicia, for this thoughtful and thought provoking new take on anxiety!&#x201d; - <strong><em> Beth Salcedo, MD, medical director of The Ross Center and President, Anxiety and Depression Association of America</em></strong></p></p><h2>Looking at Type: The Fundamentals Using Psychological Type To Understand and Appreciate Ourselves and Others</h2><p><p>Are you more actively interested in people and the world around you, or drawn to the inner world of ideas?

His father would accuse his mother of infidelity, while she railed about his emotional neglect. Not long after Sam turned six, his parents divorced. During the ensuing years, he rarely saw his father, who remarried and started a second family. In the meantime, a long string of men, his mother&#x2019;s boyfriends, moved in and out of Sam&#x2019;s life. Most of them had a hard time coping with the boy&#x2019;s defiant, hostile attitude. A few of them felt provoked enough to beat him. His mother never remarried.<br> <br>During middle school, Sam was fairly popular and an A student, though extremely intolerant of criticism. He frequently wound up in the principal&#x2019;s office for overly aggressive behavior. Even back then, before the antibullying campaign had gathered steam, his persecution of the shy and the weak regularly brought reprimands. In high school, he directed his immense competitive energy into athletics and eventually became captain of the football team, despite clashes with his coach over his disrespect and &#x201c;glory hogging.&#x201d; The coach knew his star player needed a strong paternal hand to help him manage that tormented, angry drive of his, but Sam rebuffed him. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not my dad!&#x201d; he snarled on more than one occasion. Eventually Sam received an athletic scholarship to Stanford and was recruited by Exxon upon graduation.<br> <br>As a rising corporate executive, Sam was a fierce competitor, relentless in his drive to succeed, cocky and self-confident in a way that some colleagues found charming, others abrasive. He had no close friends and viewed other people with suspicion: From his cynical perspective, everyone in life was &#x201c;playing an angle.&#x201d; When necessary, he could feign deference toward his superiors, concealing his contempt and the immense envy he felt for their wealth and power. Rising through the ranks, he demanded complete and uncritical loyalty from his own subordinates. If they complied, he generously rewarded them. But if a member of his team failed to live up to his expectations, Sam would cast that person aside without regret. Over time, he gathered around him a devoted group of hardworking men and women who both admired and feared him.<br> <br>His personal life was marked by the same competitive drive, demands for loyalty, and abrupt dismissals of those who disappointed him. After a long string of one-night stands and short-term relationships, Sam fell headlong in love with Miranda, a top runway model, whom he adored with idealistic passion. Once married, she gave up her career at his insistence. He then built them a showplace pointedly larger than the homes owned by his fellow corporate officers. They began to collect art and build a wine cellar. Sam and Miranda hosted lavish parties and elegant dinners, over which he presided with a kind of dictatorial charm.<br> <br>As Miranda aged, Sam&#x2019;s passion for her gradually cooled. When she became pregnant and &#x201c;lost her figure,&#x201d; he made snide comments and started an affair with one of his subordinates. Sam and Miranda had two sons, whom he loved in an authentic but limited way, seeing them more as reflections upon himself than as truly separate people. As a parent, he was perfectionistic and demanding but only intermittently focused on his children&#x2019;s activities. He forgot school plays and athletic events he had promised to attend. He made sure his boys went to the most expensive private schools but never attended a single parent-teacher conference.<br> <br>Though not an introspective man, Sam occasionally had his dark moments when he felt alone and uncared for, surrounded by hungry mouths he had to feed, literally and figuratively, or besieged by up-and-coming competitors who wanted his job. The world sometimes struck him as a hostile place, beset with dangers. At those moments, an angry sort of self-pity could set in. If it weren&#x2019;t for his power and money, would anyone give a damn what happened to him? Even his own mother, sunk deep into alcoholism by that time, was always hitting him up for another &#x201c;loan.&#x201d;<br> <br>As he reached the pinnacle of his career, Sam traveled the world extensively on the corporate jet, usually in the company of one of his mistresses. Whenever Miranda or the children complained about his absence, he called them ungrateful for failing to appreciate the affluent lifestyle he afforded them. Miranda eventually filed for divorce. Incensed, Sam hired a lawyer known for his slash-and-burn tactics, who so relentlessly persecuted Miranda that she finally gave up, walking away from the marriage with very little. Sam spread vicious rumors about her within their social set, telling unfounded tales about her promiscuity and drug abuse. Using his wealth as a weapon, he attempted to lure their children away from Miranda, threatening to cut them off if they didn&#x2019;t take his side.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>Sam perfectly fits the profile for Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD), a favorite diagnosis regularly made by reporters, bloggers, and professional psychologists opining in the public sphere. While the label is sometimes used loosely, with commentators applying the term &#x201c;narcissistic&#x201d; to just about anyone deemed conceited or overly focused on garnering attention, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) actually has precise criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder that are codified in its &#x201c;bible&#x201d;&#x2014;the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (or the DSM).<br> <br>So who qualifies as an &#x201c;official&#x201d; narcissist? According to the DSM, a person must demonstrate at least five of the following features to receive this diagnosis:<br> <br>�&nbsp;A grandiose sense of self-importance&#x2014;in other words, the individual exaggerates achievements and talents and expects to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements<br> <br>�&nbsp;A preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love<br> <br>�&nbsp;A belief that he or she is special and unique and can only be understood by, or should associate with, other special or high-status people (or institutions)<br> <br>�&nbsp;A need for excessive admiration<br> <br>�&nbsp;A sense of entitlement&#x2014;unreasonable expectations of especially favorable treatment or automatic compliance with his or her expectations<br> <br>�&nbsp;Interpersonally exploitative behavior&#x2014;someone who takes advantage of others to achieve his or her own ends<br> <br>�&nbsp;A lack of empathy&#x2014;a person who is unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others<br> <br>�&nbsp;Envy of others or a belief that others are envious of him or her<br> <br>�&nbsp;A demonstration of arrogant and haughty behaviors or attitudes<br> <br>Going by this strict definition, Sam definitely meets the diagnostic criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder. He displays an obvious lack of empathy; he is preoccupied with enormous success and needs uncritical admiration; he&#x2019;s arrogant, envious, and grandiose, and he ruthlessly exploits other people. In fact, Sam demonstrates more than five of the nine diagnostic criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder, which points unambiguously toward this diagnosis.<br> <br>But you probably could have made this diagnosis yourself, just by reading his story. Sam&#x2019;s case isn&#x2019;t particularly nuanced, and though you may not know someone like Sam firsthand, you&#x2019;ve probably seen similar behavior in the escapades of high-flying politicians, actors, or business titans. He&#x2019;s a classic case of Narcissistic Personality Disorder.<br> <br>But what about the other narcissists who are all around us? What about those people who fall short of the diagnostic criteria for NPD but aren&#x2019;t simply vain or conceited?<br> NARCISSISM EXISTS ON A SPECTRUM<p></p> <br>Since the first edition of the DSM was published in 1952, psychological thought and science has undergone several revolutions&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the book itself has undergone several revisions, too. In early editions, Freudian theory reigned supreme. Narcissistic tendencies were attributed to our early experiences with our mother or father, and the cure would be psychoanalysis, and lots of it.<br> <br>But beginning around 1974, Freudian theory waned in influence and a more &#x201c;scientific&#x201d; orientation came to dominate the DSM. As the pendulum swung, the APA&#x2019;s diagnosis manual began to adopt a disease model of mental illness, where psychological disorders are largely viewed as a medical condition, one that can be cured by a pill rather than by talk therapy. With its symptom checklist and elaborate numeric codes, the most recent edition (DSM5) strives to identify psychological conditions that are as discrete and circumscribed as any physical illness, such as glaucoma or asthma.<br> <br>There are many positive effects of this shift&#x2014;and viewing psychological problems as diseases rather than as moral failings has gone a long way to alleviate the stigma associated with mental illness. At the same time, the APA has taught us to view many disorders as the result of chemical imbalances or genetic defects, without exploring the meaning of their symptoms or their roots in personal history.<br> <br>Low levels of serotonin in your brain are the cause of your depression, patients are told. This pill will take care of it.<br> <br>This prevailing view of mental illness is not only misleading, it&#x2019;s dangerous. It focuses on extreme cases that fit a clinical definition without providing guidance for how to spot and cope with lesser though often serious expressions of a disorder. Narcissism isn&#x2019;t a disease that you can turn off or on with a pill. Remember that nine-point narcissism checklist from the DSM? Sam would be diagnosed with Narcissistic Personality Disorder because he met five of the nine criteria. What if he only met four of them? Or what if his ability to empathize were severely limited rather than entirely absent?<br> <br>Some men and women barely reach the diagnostic threshold for NPD. Others fall just short. A great many other people more closely fit another diagnosis but at the same time seem quite narcissistic. These people could be just as troubled, and just as destructive to themselves and those around them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and it can be difficult to get them the help they need because they don&#x2019;t fit some rigid definition in the DSM.<br> <br>In fact, narcissism exists in many shades and degrees of severity along a continuum, as do many other high-profile medical and psychological conditions, like autism or bipolar disorder. In order to understand narcissism&#x2014;to make sense of the narcissists we all know and to find ways of coping with them&#x2014;we need to look beyond its strict definition in the DSM. To see people like Sam as afflicted with a disease sets them apart, as if they have nothing to do with our own emotional experience and are therefore incomprehensible. But as I&#x2019;ll show in the pages ahead, the narcissistic features they display are actually the most extreme form of traits that show up across the spectrum of mental disorders, and more mildly in the general population.<br> <br>In short, narcissism is a universal aspect of human psychology, existing along a continuum of possible expressions.<br> <br>Although the APA sets forth nine potential criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder&#x2014;as if they were distinct disease traits as well defined as the fatigue and shortness of breath that often characterize anemia&#x2014;those nine features actually overlap and interconnect. From a psychological perspective, where symptoms have meaning, those nine actually boil down to two: an inflated sense of self-importance and a lack of empathy for other people; the remaining features are by-products that naturally follow from them.<br> <br>A person with a grandiose sense of self would likely believe herself to be unique, part of a superior elite and destined for greatness. She would feel entitled to special treatment, coming across as arrogant or haughty, and expect others to admire her. Someone who lacks empathy would more readily exploit other people for personal gain, or envy them for the simple reason that they possess what she wants.<br> <br>An inflated sense of self-importance and a lack of empathy for other people: As I&#x2019;ll be discussing throughout this book, these two psychological traits lie at the heart of narcissism. They largely define Narcissistic Personality Disorder according to the APA, but they often show up in other psychological disorders as well. An inflated sense of self-importance characterizes mania and the manic phases of bi-polar disorder. &#x201c;Ideas of reference&#x201d; that show up in paranoia, and various psychotic disorders, organize the universe around the self; other people become two-dimensional enemies, characters in one&#x2019;s personal drama, with no authentic interior life of their own. People who struggle with manic-depressive illness have little emotional room left over for other people.<br> <br>In other words, many individuals who don&#x2019;t meet the full diagnostic criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder are narcissists all the same&#x2014;Extreme Narcissists, as I refer to them. And they are all around us, causing us damage, wreaking havoc in our lives. We&#x2019;re ill equipped to cope with them. Often we don&#x2019;t even spot them until it&#x2019;s too late.<br> <br>Consider the case of Naomi.<br> THE NARCISSIST NEXT DOOR<p></p> <br>People who don&#x2019;t know her well often describe Naomi in saintly terms. In addition to her work as a kindergarten teacher, she organizes fund-raising drives for breast cancer research and takes an active part in her congregation&#x2019;s outreach to the underprivileged. At Christmas, she coordinates a gift-giving program with her local social services department, making sure that all children in foster care receive every item on their Christmas wish lists. Twice a month, she volunteers for the hot line sponsored by a shelter for battered women in her community.<br> <br>&#x201c;What this world needs,&#x201d; acquaintances often tell her, &#x201c;is more people like you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Naomi&#x2019;s three adult children have a very different view of her. &#x201c;Mother is difficult,&#x201d; they often say. It&#x2019;s hard to know in advance what will set her off, but certain subjects are clearly dangerous. They learned long ago never to contradict their mother when she vilifies her ex-husband, painting herself as a long-suffering martyr abandoned by a heartless philanderer who left in search of younger flesh. They never mention contacts with their father and lie point-blank if Naomi asks whether they&#x2019;ve seen him. Melissa, the youngest, once made the mistake of showing off an expensive watch she received from him on her birthday. Naomi acted deeply wounded and turned chilly toward Melissa, launching small digs and snide remarks for weeks thereafter.<br> <br>Naomi tends to play rotating favorites. Sometimes Molly is the good girl and her sister, Melissa, the problem; then they&#x2019;ll switch roles following some unintended slight to Naomi&#x2019;s self-regard. Their brother, Josh, the golden child, her pride and joy, seems largely immune from criticism. It helps that he&#x2019;s a successful surgeon with a large home in the finest part of town. He buys his mother a new car every few years and occasionally sends her on a Mediterranean cruise. At work, Naomi goes on and on to her colleagues about her dutiful, generous, loving, successful, and wealthy son. How he dotes on her!<br> <br>If the two sisters have lunch alone, or all three siblings get together without inviting Naomi, they know better than to mention it: She&#x2019;d feel left out and jealous. &#x201c;Once her children are grown,&#x201d; Naomi often says in martyred tones, &#x201c;a mother just doesn&#x2019;t matter.&#x201d; However, at full family gatherings, she st...</p><h2>The Mad Mick: Book One of The Mad Mick Series</h2><p>&#x201c;Rock-solid characters, buzz-saw action and backstories deserving of books of their own. Amazing...&#x201d; Conor Maguire nearly lost his daughter Barb when she was three years old, injured by the drunk driver that killed his wife. When the justice system failed him, Conor -- the son and grandson of IRA bombers -- retaliated against the driver in dramatic and gruesome fashion. While an ironclad alibi prevented the police from pinning the murder on Conor, it did not prevent a covert agency within the US government from recruiting the talented young bomber and machinist. For over twenty-five years, Conor designed and built custom weapons of death and destruction at his compound in the mountains of Virginia. Then a series of devastating terror attacks brought down the United States. Conor and Barb assumed they were safe in their secure compound. They had food and a water source. They were armed and highly-trained. Then Barb was kidnapped. The kidnappers, needing slave labor for their farm, didn&#x2019;t know why Conor was known as The Mad Mick. They didn&#x2019;t know the fear and respect his name invoked in the shadowy world of covert operations. They didn&#x2019;t know that when it came to protecting his family, he was without conscience, without compassion, and without equal. But they would soon find out.</p><p></p><h2>Six Moments Musicaux, Op. 16: Schirmer Library of Classics Volume 2013 Piano Solo (Schirmer&#39;s Library of Musical Classics)</h2><p>(Piano).

Bradt's <em>Faroe Islands</em> offers detailed information about all 18 islands and the breathtaking landscapes which never fail to inspire visitors, from the highest sea cliffs in Europe at Enniberg on the island of Vi�oy to the dramatic seascapes at Akraberg, the southernmost point of the Faroes.

Suggestions for visiting the island of Su�uroy are detailed, plus there are updated reviews of all accommodation, eating and drinking options. Fourteen clear and easy-to-use maps are also featured. Written by expert author James Proctor, who has been visiting the Faroes since 1992, this latest edition includes all the most recent developments and provides all the information needed for a successful trip.

Whilst working as the BBC's Scandinavia correspondent, he produced a series of television and radio reports about the islands, concentrating on the issues of independence and whaling. James now divides his time as a freelance travel writer between the south of France and his home in North Yorkshire.

Gnawing at reason and enslaving minds, it has killed many and defeated countless others. But in 1953, Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay stared into its dark eye and did not waver. On May 29, they pushed spent bodies and aching lungs past the achievable to pursue the impossible. At a terminal altitude of 29,028 feet, they stood triumphant atop the highest peak in the world.<br> With nimble words and a straightforward style, New Zealand mountaineering legend Hillary recollects the bravery and frustration, the agony and glory that marked his Everest odyssey. From the 1951 expedition that led to the discovery of the Southern Route, through the grueling Himalayan training of 1952, and on to the successful 1953 expedition led by Colonel John Hunt, Hillary conveys in precise language the mountain's unforgiving conditions. In explicit detail he recalls an Everest where chaotic icefalls force costly detours, unstable snow ledges promise to avalanche at the slightest misstep, and brutal weather shifts from pulse-stopping cold to fiendish heat in mere minutes. <br> In defiance of these torturous conditions, Hillary remains enthusiastic and never hesitates in his quest for the summit. Despite the enormity of his and Norgay's achievement, he regards himself, Norgay, and the other members of his expedition as hardworking men, not heroes. And while he never would have reached the top without practiced skill and technical competence, his thrilling memoir speaks first to his admiration of the human drive to explore, to understand, to risk, and to conquer.<br></p><p><br><em>Sir Edmund Percival Hillary</em> was born in Auckland, New Zealand, on July 20, 1919. On May 29, 1953, he and Nepalese mountaineer Tenzing Norgay reached the summit of Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world.

Opening with a blazing manifesto of an introduction in which Paglia outlines the bedrock beliefs that inform her writing&#x2014;freedom of speech, the necessity of fearless inquiry, and a deep respect for all art, both erudite and popular&#x2014;<i>Provocations</i> gathers together a rich, varied body of work spanning twenty-five years, illuminating everything from the <i>Odyssey</i> to the Oscars, from punk rock to presidents past and present. Whatever your political inclination or literary and artistic touchstones, Paglia&#x2019;s takes are compulsively readable, thought provoking, galvanizing, and an essential part of our cultural dialogue, invariably giving voice to what most needs to be said.<br><b><b><br></b></b></p><p>Camille Paglia is the University Professor of Humanities and Media Studies at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia. She is the author of <i>Free Women, Free Men</i>; <i>Glittering Images</i>; <i>Break, Blow, Burn</i>; <i>The Birds</i>; <i>Vamps &amp; Tramps</i>; <i>Sex, Art, and</i> <i>American Culture</i>; and <i>Sexual Personae</i>.<b>Introduction </b><br><br> This book is not for everyone.<br><br> It is not for those who believe that they and their friends, allies, political parties, or churches have found the absolute truth about mankind, present or future.<br><br> It is not for those who believe that language must be policed to serve what they view as a higher social good, nor is it for those who grant to government and its proxies on college campuses the right to require and enforce &#x201c;correct&#x201d; thinking.<br><br> It is not for those who believe that art is a servant of political agendas or philanthropic goals or that it contains hidden coercive messages that must be exposed and destroyed.<br><br> It is not for those who see women as victims and men as the enemy or who think that women are incapable of asserting their rights and human dignity everywhere, including the workplace, without the intervention and protection of authority figures deputized by the power of the state.<br><br> It is not for those who see human behavior as wholly formed by oppressive social forces and who deny the shadowy influence of evolution and biology on desire, fantasy, and anarchic impulse, from love to crime.<br><br> This book is instead for those who elevate free thought and free speech over all other values, including material considerations of wealth, status, or physical well-being.<br><br> It is for those who see art and the contemplation of art as a medium of intuition and revelation, a web work of meaning that should be enhanced and celebrated and not demeaned by teachers who cynically deny the possibility of meaning.<br><br> It is for those who see women as men&#x2019;s equals who, in their just and necessary demand for equality before the law, do not plead for special protections for women as a weaker sex.<br><br> It is for those who see nature as a vast and sublime force which mankind is too puny to control or alter and which fatefully shapes us as individuals and as a species.<br><br> It is for those who see life in spiritual terms as a quest for enlightenment, a dynamic process of ceaseless observation, reflection, and self-education.<br><br> A premise of this book, following the great cultural revolution of the 1960s, which was thwarted by the reactionary and elitist forces of academic postmodernism, is that higher consciousness transcends all distinctions of race, class, and gender. Sixties multiculturalism was energized by a convergence of influences from world religions&#x2014;both Buddhism (a legacy of the Beat writers) and Hinduism, which suffused popular music. Standard interpretation of the radical 1960s in exclusively political terms is a common but major error that I address in detail in an essay collected here, &#x201c;Cults and Cosmic Consciousness: Religious Vision in the American 1960s&#x201d;.<br><br> Although I am an atheist, I have immense admiration and respect for religion as a comprehensive symbol-system, far more profound in its poetry, insight, and metaphysical sweep than anything currently offered by secular humanism. In my Cornerstone Arts Lecture at Colorado College, &#x201c;Religion and the Arts in America&#x201d; (also collected here), I demonstrate how central religion has been to American culture and how its emotionally expressive and multiracial gospel tradition remains the principal reason for America&#x2019;s continued world dominance in commercial popular music.<br><br> I have argued for decades that true multiculturalism would be achieved in education not by splintering the curriculum into politicized fiefdoms but by making comparative religion the core curriculum of world education. An early piece on this subject (published in my first essay collection, <i>Sex, Art, and American Culture</i> in 1991) was &#x201c;East and West: An Experiment in Multiculturalism&#x201d;, a chronicle of an interdisciplinary humanities course that I co-taught with artist and social activist Lily Yeh at the University of the Arts. In the present volume, the same theme is addressed in my opening statement for a 2017 debate at the Yale Political Union, &#x201c;Resolved: Religion Belongs in the Curriculum&#x201d;.<br><br> <i>Provocations</i> covers the two and a half decades since my last general essay collection, <i>Vamps &amp; Tramps</i>, in 1994. Some of my articles and lectures on sex, gender, and feminism were published separately a year ago in <i>Free Women, Free Men. </i>The latter volume contains my 1991 New York <i>Newsday</i> op-ed on date-rape that caused prolonged controversy as the first public protest against an escalating hysteria around that issue on college campuses and in the media. I continue to espouse my code of &#x201c;street-smart feminism&#x201d;, which frankly acknowledges the risks and dangers of life and encourages women to remain eternally vigilant and alert and to accept responsibility for their choices and adventures.<br><br> However, as the generations pass since the sexual revolution launched in 1960 by the release of the first birth-control pill, discourse about sex has become progressively more ideological, rigid, and banal. The feminist rejection of Freud as sexist has eliminated basic tools of psychological analysis once standard in cultural criticism. Few young adults with elite school degrees today appear to realize how romantic attractions and interactions often repeat patterns rooted in early family life. Nor do they seem to have heard of the complex principle of ambivalence, which produces mixed messages that can disastrously complicate social encounters.<br><br> In my first book, <i>Sexual Personae </i>(1990), I wrote extensively about the tormented fragility of male sexual identity&#x2014;which most feminist theory, with its bitterly anti-male premises, seems incapable of recognizing. Too often, women fail to realize how much power they have over men, whose ambition and achievement in the public realm are often wedded to remorseless anxiety and insecurity. Canonical feminist theory has also missed the emotional and conceptual symbolism in sexual behavior&#x2014;as in the infantile penile displays of entertainment industry moguls who appear to have routinely chosen as targets women who would show embarrassment, confusion, or fear and not those who would laugh, scold, or whack that tender member with the nearest shoe, purse, hairbrush, or lamp. Interpreting such pathetically squalid scenes in exclusively political rather than psychological terms does not help women to make their way through the minefield of a professional world that will always be stressful, competitive, and uncertain for aspirants of both sexes.<br><br> The masculine dream of sexual freedom is writ large in the drawings of Tom of Finland, who heavily influenced gay male iconography after World War Two and directly inspired photographer Robert Mapplethorpe (whom I defended in <i>Sex, Art, and American Culture</i>). My essay, &#x201c;Sex Quest in Tom of Finland&#x201d;, which was written for the massive Taschen edition of Tom&#x2019;s collected works, stresses the pagan energy, vitality, and humor of Tom&#x2019;s pornographic all-male world, with its panoply of archetypes borrowed from Hollywood and Nazi-era Finland.<br><br> The initial theme of my work, however, was not masculinity but androgyny, the subject of my doctoral dissertation at Yale. (Its title was <i>Sexual Personae: The Androgyne in Literature and Art</i>.) When the prospectus for my thesis was accepted in 1971, it was the only dissertation on sex at the Yale Graduate School. While completing its writing at my first teaching job at Bennington College, I was electrified by David Bowie in his Ziggy Stardust phase, which seemed to encapsulate everything that I had been thinking about gender. Forty years later, Bowie would put <i>Sexual Personae</i> on a list of his 100 favorite books. It did not surprise me: that great artist was sensing himself mirrored back from my pages. It was a tremendous honor to be invited by London&#x2019;s Victoria &amp; Albert Museum to write the article on gender for the catalog of its mammoth 2013 exhibition of Bowie costumes, which then toured the world. That essay, &#x201c;Theater of Gender: David Bowie at the Climax of the Sexual Revolution&#x201d;, is reprinted here.<br><br> As I have often said, my own protest against gender norms began in childhood with my flagrantly dissident Halloween costumes: Robin Hood at age five; a toreador at six; a Roman soldier at seven; Napoleon at eight; Hamlet at nine. (A photo of me as Napoleon appears elsewhere in this book.) From college on, I adopted the gender-bending styles of Mod London, which were effectively transvestite. However, despite my lifelong transgender identification, I do not accept most of the current transgender agenda, which denies biological sex differences, dictates pronouns, and recklessly promotes medical and surgical interventions. An excerpt from an interview with the Weekly Standard, where I condemn the use of puberty blockers on children as a violation of human rights, is collected here. When <i>Sexual Personae</i> was released, I called it &#x201c;the biggest sex change in history&#x201d;. Gore Vidal rightly said that the voice of <i>Sexual Personae </i>was the voice of his transsexual heroine, Myra Breckinridge. Aggressive, implacable, and scathingly satirical, that voice is a transgender construction, using the materials of language and mind. To questioning young people drawn to the siren song of hormones and surgery, I say: stay fluid! Stay free! <br><br> It is surely my sexually dual perspective that has allowed me to understand and sympathize with Alfred Hitchcock&#x2019;s awed and quasi-mystical view of women, which so many other feminists have reductively condemned as &#x201c;misogynous&#x201d;. I defended Hitchcock in my British Film Institute book on <i>The Birds </i>(1998), as well as in essays such as &#x201c;Women and Magic in Alfred Hitchcock&#x201d;, written for the BFI&#x2019;s 2012 Hitchcock retrospective and collected here. Other pieces on film in this book celebrate movie music and lament the waning of European art film as well as the decline of film criticism.<br><br> One of my principal ambitions since my student days has been to develop an interpretative style that could integrate high and popular culture, which had exploded during the 1960s. I call myself a Warholite: Andy Warhol&#x2019;s improvisational, avant-garde short films (starring gay hustlers and drag queens) and his conversion of publicity photos of Hollywood stars into radiant Byzantine icons provided an inspiring template for my work. In contrast, I detest and oppose academic media studies that monotonously recycle judgmental, politicized terminology from the pass� Frankfurt School, which has no feeling whatever for popular culture.<br><br> <i>Provocations</i>, I submit, demonstrates the range and flexibility of my system of interpretation, which fiercely attacks when necessary but which respectfully illuminates both the artist and the artwork, from Old Masters like Shakespeare and Leonardo to modern music stars like Prince and Rihanna. In college, I was impatient with the New Criticism, which I felt was too narrow and genteel and had to be urgently expanded with history and psychology. But I have continued to apply the New Critical technique of close textual analysis to everything I write about, as in my pieces here on Picasso&#x2019;s &#x201c;Girl Before a Mirror&#x201d; or on what I call the &#x201c;psychotic mysticism&#x201d; of poet Theodore Roethke. One of my long-range goals in college was to break down the barriers between genres, and I believe that my interdisciplinary method has in fact done that&#x2014;extending the same minute focus and dramatic commentary to all of the arts but also to contemporary politics.<br><br> My columns and op-eds on politics over the past quarter century are too numerous to reprint or even catalog. I think I showed special facility for analyzing the horse race of presidential primaries, when my reviews of televised debates, for example, were usually far more attuned than those of the major media to how the candidates were actually being perceived by mainstream voters. I consider the cover-story Salon.com interview (collected here) that I did with editor-in-chief David Talbot in February 2003 to be a supreme highlight of my career: I was virtually alone among political commentators in condemning the imminent invasion of Iraq. Other leading media, including the New York Times and the New Yorker, had shockingly surrendered to tissue-thin government propaganda.<br><br> Full columns have been reproduced here on three political figures: Bill Clinton, Sarah Palin, and Donald Trump. I have written so voluminously and variously about Hillary Clinton since the Clintons&#x2019; arrival on the national scene in 1992 that there was no one piece that could be considered representative. Hence I have interwoven excerpts about her from numerous articles in the Media Chronicle at the back of the book. (It lists articles in English only. My extensive articles and interviews on politics, art, and other subjects in the foreign press, particularly in Italy and Brazil, have been omitted.) The reader should be forewarned that I began as a Hillary fan but became steadily disillusioned over the years.<br><br> I was speaking, writing, and crusading about the first woman president throughout the 1990s, when most other feminists were absorbed with policy issues. Reproduced in this book is a poster advertising my appearance at a 1996 debate at the Yale Political Union (&#x201c;Resolved: America Needs a Female President&#x201d;), which was recorded for national TV broadcast by C-SPAN. The Media Chronicle also contains excerpts of then-controversial columns or articles where I was notably prescient, as a registered Democrat, about developing problems and evasions in my own party that would eventually lead, many years later, to its stunning surprise defeat in the 2016 presidential election.<br><br> Education is a major theme in this book. As a career teacher of nearly half a century, I have watched American universities miss their epochal opportunity for radical curricular reform in the 1970s and descend decade by decade into the balkanized, bureaucratic, therapeutic customer-service operations that they are today. High scholarly standards and deep erudition (as admirably exemplified by the stiff, stuffy, old-guard professors at Yale when I arrived as a graduate student) have so vanished that their value and indeed their very existence is denied by today&#x2019;s bright, shiny, and shallow academic theorists. The real revolution would have been to smash the departmental structure of the humanities, reunite the fragmented fields of literature and art, and create an authentically multicultural global curriculum. <br><br> A principal piece in this volume is &#x201c;The North American Intellectual Tradition&#x201d;, which was given as the Second Annual Marshall McLuhan Lecture at Fordham University. There as in my long expos�, &#x201c;Junk Bonds and Corporate Raiders&#x201d; (published by Arion in 1991 and reprinted in <i>Sex, Art, and American Culture</i>), I reject European post-structuralism and call for a reorientation toward North American pragmatism, grounded in nature. The academic stampede toward pretentious, abstruse French theorists in the 1970s was a grotesque betrayal of the American 1960s, which was animated by a Romantic return to nature and a reconnection of art with the sensory&#x2014;the dynamic life of the body. Michel Foucault&#x2019;s primary influence, by his own admission, was playwright Samuel Beckett--whose depressive postwar nihilism was swept away by the communal music and dance of the 1960s.

Her family&#x2019;s life may depend on it.In the early 1930s, life for the Jews is on the brink of ruin: Hitler has come to power, and the golden memories of happy times are fading fast. One young couple, Margret and Heinz Lichtenstern, decide to flee Germany with their parents and daughter, Tutti. They move to Amsterdam, where Heinz is able to continue his work and where there seems to be hope for the future. Two years later, Tutti&#x2019;s brother is born, and the family is prospering.But then Germany invades the Netherlands. And in the pre-dawn hours of May 10, 1940, the Lichtensterns suddenly learn that they have not moved far enough. This is the true story of what the Lichtensterns endured under the Nazis. Told by Tutti&#x2019;s daughter, Heidi, and filled with historical documents and photos, it vividly recreates how one family conquered fear and heartbreak to survive. Theirs is a tale of both unimaginable devastation and lucky surprises&#x2014;raids, sabotage, helpful friends and strangers, and a very special gift.One family. One remarkable story. And in the end, a promise kept.</p><p>When my mother speaks to school groups about her experiences during the Holocaust, I watch the children. They are captivated. Often, they have tears in their eyes. Some have read <i>The Diary of a Young Girl</i> by Anne Frank. Others have read <i>Night </i>by Elie Wiesel. They are studying World War II and the Holocaust in school, but the woman who is standing in front of their class lived through it. The students listen quietly, without fidgeting. They are respectful and truly honored to have her as a guest speaker. <br><br>I wonder to myself how many more times she will do this. She is healthy and strong for her age, but how much longer will she be willing and able to tell her story? The students in these classes are among the last generation that will hear survivors or witnesses of the Holocaust. <br><br>The children ask many questions, and she answers them all carefully and thoughtfully. They ask about the small details: what were the mattresses made of? They ask spiritual questions: did her faith help her through? And they ask deeper questions: what did she miss the most?<br><br>I believe the most important question is this: What does "never forget" mean? It is the reason that my mother continues to tell her story and teachers continue to invite her to come to their classrooms. Never forget. People say it when they talk about the Holocaust, and it can take on many meanings. Some say that in means we have to remember the victims. Some way we need to honor the survivors. And other say we need to fight anti-Semitism. All of that is true. <br><br>For me, "never forget" means we need to learn from history. We need to understand that prejudice hurts: it injures the people who are discriminated against, and it damages the people who hold the biased views. Emphasizing differences between people and using those disparities to demean or intimidate others is insensitive and cruel. Instead, we need to notice our similarities as human beings and find ways to bridge the gaps that divide us in order to move forward toward positive human relations. "Never forget" reminds us that seven billion people need to find a way to live peacefully on this one small planet. <br><br>In 2007, at the age of seventy-two, my mother began speaking to school groups about her experiences. Since then, thousands of students have listened to her presentation. This book will ensure that her story is never forgotten.In 2007, at the age of seventy-two, the author's mother began speaking to school groups about her experiences.

First invented in the 1970s, <i>make</i> still turns up to this day as the central engine in most programming projects; it even builds the Linux kernel. In the third edition of the classic <i>Managing Projects with GNU make</i>, readers will learn why this utility continues to hold its top position in project build software, despite many younger competitors.The premise behind <i>make</i> is simple: after you change source files and want to rebuild your program or other output files, <i>make</i> checks timestamps to see what has changed and rebuilds just what you need, without wasting time rebuilding other files. But on top of this simple principle, <i>make</i> layers a rich collection of options that lets you manipulate multiple directories, build different versions of programs for different platforms, and customize your builds in other ways.This edition focuses on the GNU version of <i>make</i>, which has deservedly become the industry standard. GNU make contains powerful extensions that are explored in this book. It is also popular because it is free software and provides a version for almost every platform, including a version for Microsoft Windows as part of the free Cygwin project. <i>Managing Projects with GNU make</i>, 3rd Edition provides guidelines on meeting the needs of large, modern projects. Also added are a number of interesting advanced topics such as portability, parallelism, and use with Java.Robert Mecklenburg, author of the third edition, has used <i>make</i> for decades with a variety of platforms and languages. In this book he zealously lays forth how to get your builds to be as efficient as possible, reduce maintenance, avoid errors, and thoroughly understand what <i>make</i> is doing. Chapters on C++ and Java provide makefile entries optimized for projects in those languages. The author even includes a discussion of the makefile used to build the book.</p></p><p>The Power of GNU make for Building Anything<p>Robert Mecklenburg began using Unix as a student in 1977 and has been programming professionally for 23 years. His make experience started in 1982 at NASA with Unix version 7. Robert received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Utah in 1991.

At that moment of discovery, a jolt grips you with intense curiosity.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Q: Fascination draws you in?</b><br>A: Exactly. Who were these people? What did their strange symbols mean? How did they create such intense history and what were their daily lives like? You wonder what it would be like to walk the streets of ancient Egypt and see what they saw.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Q: What defining moment made you write about ancient Egypt?</b><br>A: On a school field trip to a museum, I saw a mummy in a glass case. The mummy's fingers were poking through the wrappings. When I got over how wonderfully creepy it looked, something happened. It dawned on me that those fingers, that hand, once did normal human things; tucked a child in at night, held another person's hand, brushed hair out of eyes on windy days. All thousands of years ago. Somehow, the emotion of the person was still there in that mummy. He wasn't just an artifact. He was a person with stories to tell. I decided then and there I wanted to give life to the ancient past in a way that was fun and approachable.<br><br><b>Q: What message do you have for your readers?</b>A: I know many of you are Egypt obsessed like me.

Its global scope and human toll reveal the true face of modern, industrialized warfare. Now, for the first time, we have a comprehensive, single-volume account of how and why this global conflict evolved as it did. <i>A War To Be Won</i> is a unique and powerful operational history of the Second World War that tells the full story of battle on land, on sea, and in the air.</p><p>Williamson Murray and Allan R. Millett analyze the operations and tactics that defined the conduct of the war in both the European and Pacific Theaters. Moving between the war room and the battlefield, we see how strategies were crafted and revised, and how the multitudes of combat troops struggled to discharge their orders. The authors present incisive portraits of the military leaders, on both sides of the struggle, demonstrating the ambiguities they faced, the opportunities they took, and those they missed. Throughout, we see the relationship between the actual operations of the war and their political and moral implications.</p><p><i>A War To Be Won</i> is the culmination of decades of research by two of America&#x2019;s premier military historians. It avoids a celebratory view of the war but preserves a profound respect for the problems the Allies faced and overcame as well as a realistic assessment of the Axis accomplishments and failures. It is the essential military history of World War II&#x2015;from the Sino&#x2013;Japanese War in 1937 to the surrender of Japan in 1945&#x2015;for students, scholars, and general readers alike.</p></p><p>Williamson Murray is Senior Fellow at the Institute for Defense Analysis, Washington, D.C.&#x201c;The West's eventual triumph is the subject of <i>A War To Be Won</i>, a comprehensive and highly readable history by two eminent and prolific military historians. Williamson Murray and Allan Millett focus on operations but range far and wide into politics, strategy, military doctrines (why armies fight the way they do), weapons, science and tactics, from the bumbling politics of the '30s to the Cold War... This is edgy, though expert, history. The ordeal of the Soviet war against Germany is dramatically and vividly told, as is the pillage and rape that Red Army soldiers inflicted on prisoners and civilians within reach.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Robert Killebrew</b><b>, </b><b><i>Washington Post</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;World War II is fast slipping from memory. So it takes a book, such as <i>A War To Be Won</i>...to make one realize the horror of that conflict... In this comprehensive history of the military aspect of World War II...[the authors] provide a broad view of the two-hemisphere tragedy.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Fred Slater</b><b>, </b><b><i>St. Joseph News-Press</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Thousands of books have been published about World War II, but very few have possessed he level of scholarly perspective, encompassing scale and insightful detail to be found in this one. With its penetrating view of operational strategy on all sides during the war, it is among the finest of WWII studies and the best one-volume account of the military conflict I've ever read.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>William W. Starr, Columbia State</b><br><br>&#x201c;Two highly accomplished historians...collaborated to produce this magnificent one-volume history of World War II. While they do not neglect political or economic factors, what truly sets this work apart is their focus on 'the conduct of operations by the military organizations that waged the war.' ...This is a riveting book that stimulates as much as it informs&#x2015;and is a must read for any student of World War II or military professional.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Richard B. Frank</b><b>, </b><b><i>Naval History</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;An outstanding single-volume history of [a] central moment... [The authors] write in a brisk, confident and knowledgeable style, often sprinkling their analyses with pithy irony, sardonic wit and sharp insights... Murray and Millett have produced a magnificent volume, one that will fascinate and enlighten both expert and layman alike. <i>A War To Be Won</i> now takes its place as the core volume in any library on the history of the Second World War, and it will likely remain so for years to come.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Calvin L. Christman</b><b>, </b><b><i>Dallas Morning News</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In <i>A War To Be Won: Fighting the Second World War</i>, Williamson Murray and Allan Millett have...eschewed grand strategy for what they describe as operational history. They have plugged a large gap... They combine firm and fresh judgments with common humanity; and they achieve balance not only between the theaters of war but also between themselves. Murray knows about Germany, Britain and air power, Millett about the United States and its armed forces. If they divided their subject matter accordingly, the seams are never evident. This is an outstanding history of the war.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Hew Strachan</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;While...several volumes present admirably comprehensive panoramas of the second world war, the very nature of this approach precludes close operational analysis as opposed to general operational narrative. This is the gap that <i>A War To Be Won</i> fills&#x2015;an operational history of the 1939&#x2013;1945 war focusing on military operations, with dispassionate discussion of military effectiveness whether involving the Allies or the Axis... <i>A War To Be Won</i>, confined within a single volume, is a remarkable achievement deserving of the many plaudits it has received. It has a narrative deftness that will attract the general reader, operational analysis incisive and original enough to engage the specialist, technical evaluation and tactical appraisal of military effectiveness in abundance, though not without controversial, even acerbic comment where appropriate.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John Erickson</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Military historians Williamson Murray and Allan R. Millett dissect tactics and operations of the war's major players in <i>A War To Be Won</i>... Unlike other volumes on WWII, many of which examine the soldiers' day-to-day life in the trenches, <i>A War To Be Won</i> focuses on the overall picture, the strategic successes and failures of the warring nations.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Dick Kreck</b><b>, </b><b><i>Denver Post</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Murray and Millett] are military historians but take an extraordinarily broad view of the conflict [of World War II]&#x2015;its political and economic origins, its diplomatic maneuvering, its strategic designs and its human toll, but above all its combat. In 600-plus pages, they zero in on the troops who did the fighting and the commanders who led&#x2015;and sometimes misled&#x2015;them... The writing is brisk and lively, the revelations sometimes startling, and the selection of photographs generous and revealing. This is as masterful and readable a one-volume history of the Second World War as anyone is likely to write.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Herbert Kupferberg</b><b>, </b><b><i>Parade Magazine</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The best synthesis of all of [the] new scholarship on WWII is, in my opinion, Williamson Murray and Allan Millett's superb comprehensive history of the war...

Through healing himself, he made revolutionary discoveries, culminating in the development of the method that now bears his name. In an intellectually rich and eloquent style, Feldenkrais delves into neurology, prehistory, child development, gravity and anti-gravity, reflexive versus learned behavior, the effects of emotion, especially anxiety, on posture, and most importantly, the inseparability of body and mind.</p><p>Moshe Feldenkrais, D.Sc., is the founder of what is today called the Feldenkrais Method. As a result of suffering debilitating injuries, Feldenkrais began an intense exploration into the relationship between bodily movement and healing, feeling, thinking, and learning. In the process of healing himself, Feldenkrais made revolutionary discoveries, culminating in the development of the method that now bears his name. There are two aspects to his method: an individual manipulatory technique of neuromotor education called Functional Integration and a group technique called Awareness Through Movement. His unique and subtle approach to facilitating human change and to improving functioning is spelled out in a number of influential books, including <i>Awareness Through Movement</i>, <i>The Elusive Obvious,</i> and <i>The Potent Self</i>. Dr. Feldenkrais was also the author of a number of books about Judo and one of the first Europeans to hold a black belt in the art. Today there are nearly four thousand Feldenkrais Method practitioners around the world. Moshe Feldenkrais died in 1980 and his insights continue to contribute to the development of the new field of somatic education and continue to influence disciplines such as the arts, education, psychology, child development, physical and occupational therapy, sports enhancement, and gerontology.Carl Ginsburg, Ph.D. is one of Dr. Feldenkrais&#x2019;s original students and holds a Ph.D. in Chemistry. He has been involved with the Feldenkrais Method for thirty years."Of all his books, it [<i>Body and Mature Behavior</i>] remains the most succinct statement of his fundamental theory: A 'whole situation,' systems view of physical movement, thought, emotion, sensation, and environment."- Mark Reese, author of a soon-to-be-published biography of Feldenkrais and co-author of <i>Relaxercise</i>"<i>Body &amp; Mature Behavior</i> powerfully presents Moshe Feldenkrais&#x2019;s masterful genius in integrating body and mind, theory and practice, nature and culture, freedom and constraint."- Richard Shusterman, professor of philosophy at Florida Atlantic University and author of <i>Performing Live</i>"<i>Body &amp; Mature Behavior</i> is a seminal work of creative thinking in which Feldenkrais articulates the philosophical underpinnings for the development of his extraordinary approach to human growth and learning, now known as the Feldenkrais Method."- Jim Stephens PhD, PT, CFP, member of physical therapy faculty at Temple University</p><h2>Is There Life After Football?: Surviving the NFL</h2><p><p><b>A human face on the realities of professional football, from the challenges players face after leaving the NFL to the factors that can enable them to continue to find success</b><br> 2016 Best Book Award, North American Society for the Sociology of Sport<br>Is There Life After Football?draws upon the experiences of hundreds of former players as they describe their lives playing the sport and after their football days are over. The &#x201c;bubble&#x201d;-like conditions of privilege that NFL players experience while playing, often leave players unprepared for the real world once they retire and must manage their own lives. The book also reveals the difficulties affecting former NFL players in retirement: social isolation, financial concerns, inadequate career planning, psychological challenges, and physical injuries. From players who make reckless and unsustainable financial investments during their very few high-earning years, to players who struggle to form personal and professional relationships outside of football, the stories in the book put a very human face on the realities of professional football. George Koonce Jr., a former NFL player himself, weaves in his own story throughout, explaining the challenges he encountered and decisions that helped him succeed after leaving the sport. Ultimately, Is There Life After Football? concludes that, despite the challenges players face, it is possible for players to find success after leaving the NFL if they have the right support, education, and awareness of what might await them. </p><br><p> Instructor's Guide</p></p><p><p><b>James A.

This time, Toby's birthday has arrived and the household pets are relegated to the cellar, to keep them away from a mysterious "special" present that consists of seven suitcases with a creature inside each. Demonstrating his powers of deduction (as celebrated as they are convoluted), Chester determines that Toby's parents have procured seven new pets and that Chester and company have, alas, become obsolete. While Bunnicula maintains his usual silence, Chester inveigles Harold and Howie the dachshund puppy into a hare-brained plot to convince Toby's family that they are pets without peer--and they succeed, although perhaps not as Chester intended. Throughout, Howe's lighthearted narrative balances humor with suspense, while the unusual clarity of Morrill's illustrations neatly contains the animals' chaotic capers.

In <i>Lynching and Spectacle</i>, Amy Wood explains what it meant for white Americans to perform and witness these sadistic spectacles and how lynching played a role in establishing and affirming white supremacy. Lynching, Wood argues, overlapped with a variety of cultural practices and performances, both traditional and modern, including public executions, religious rituals, photography, and cinema, all which encouraged the horrific violence and gave it social acceptability. However, she also shows how the national dissemination of lynching images ultimately fueled the momentum of the antilynching movement and the decline of the practice. Using a wide range of sources, including photos, newspaper reports, pro- and antilynching pamphlets, early films, and local city and church records, Wood reconfigures our understanding of lynching's relationship to modern life.<br><br>Wood expounds on the critical role lynching spectacles played in establishing and affirming white supremacy at the turn of the century, particularly in towns and cities experiencing great social instability and change.

Long</h2><p>From the moment he took office as governor in 1928 to the day an assassin&#x2019;s bullet cut him down in 1935, Huey Long wielded all but dictatorial control over the state of Louisiana. A man of shameless ambition and ruthless vindictiveness, Long orchestrated elections, hired and fired thousands at will, and deployed the state militia as his personal police force. And yet, paradoxically, as governor and later as senator, Long did more good for the state&#x2019;s poor and uneducated than any politician before or since. Outrageous demagogue or charismatic visionary? In this powerful new biography, Richard D. White, Jr., brings Huey Long to life in all his blazing, controversial glory. <br>White taps invaluable new source material to present a fresh, vivid portrait of both the man and the Depression era that catapulted him to fame. From his boyhood in dirt-poor Winn Parish, Long knew he was destined for power&#x2013;the problem was how to get it fast enough to satisfy his insatiable appetite. With cunning and crudity unheard of in Louisiana politics, Long crushed his opponents in the 1928 gubernatorial race, then immediately set about tightening his iron grip. The press attacked him viciously, the oil companies howled for his blood after he pushed through a controversial oil processing tax, but Long had the adulation of the people. In 1930, the Kingfish got himself elected senator, and then there was no stopping him.<br>White&#x2019;s account of Long&#x2019;s heyday unfolds with the mesmerizing intensity of a movie. Pegged by President Roosevelt as &#x201c;one of the two most dangerous men in the country,&#x201d; Long organized a radical movement to redistribute money through his Share Our Wealth Society&#x2013;and his gospel of pensions for all, a shorter workweek, and free college spread like wildfire. The Louisiana poor already worshiped him for building thousands of miles of roads and funding schools, hospitals, and universities; his outrageous antics on the Senate floor gained him a growing national base. By 1935, despite a barrage of corruption investigations, Huey Long announced that he was running for president.<br>In the end, Long was a tragic hero&#x2013;a power addict who squandered his genius and came close to destroying the very foundation of democratic rule. Kingfish is a balanced, lucid, and absolutely spellbinding portrait of the life and times of the most incendiary figure in the history of American politics.</p><p>Richard D. White, Jr., is a professor of public administration at Louisiana State University and the author of Roosevelt the Reformer: Theodore Roosevelt as Civil Service Commissioner 1889&#x2014;1895. He lives in Baton Rouge.CHAPTER 1<br><br> 1927<br><br> A WEDDED MAN WITH A STORM FOR A BRIDE<br><br> Huey Long climbed onto a large bale of fresh-picked cotton and gazed out at a crowd of farmers attending a country fair. For a few moments he stood motionless, his shoulders hunched like a boxer waiting for the first bell to ring. Leaning forward to talk to the men in the front row, Huey began speaking in a whispery voice so quiet that the crowd shuffled closer to hear him. After a couple of minutes, he slowly raised his voice, a little louder each minute, until he roared to the gathering throng. He threw off his coat, rolled up his shirtsleeves, and slackened the red silk tie hanging around his neck. His voice booming across the dusty fairgrounds, Huey pummeled his audience with old-fashioned soapbox oratory and hell-for-leather political bluster. He whooped and hollered, pounded his fist, and punched in the air at imaginary enemies. His face turned the color of a ripe tomato. Twirling his arms above his head in the sweltering Louisiana heat, perspiration pouring down his cheeks, he quickly captivated the audience with spellbinding charisma and homespun guile.<br><br> It was the summer of 1927 and Huey was running full speed for governor of Louisiana. At every stop on the campaign trail, he treated his listeners to a boiling mixture of snake-oil salesmanship, burlesque tap dancing, evangelicism, and blistering billingsgate. He would preach to the crowd, holding a Bible in his hand in holy uplift and quoting from memory lengthy passages of the Scriptures. From Galatians he taunted his adversaries. &#x201c;Am I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?&#x201d; More often though, Huey spewed a torrent of abuse upon his foes. He branded his political opponents with epithets like &#x201c;low-down vile and slanderous men,&#x201d; &#x201c;thieves, bugs, and lice,&#x201d; &#x201c;grafters and money boodlers,&#x201d; &#x201c;graveyard robbing politicians,&#x201d; and &#x201c;blackguards in full-dress suits.&#x201d; His audience, mostly rural folk who took their politics raw like corn whiskey, could not get enough. &#x201c;You tell &#x2019;em, Huey,&#x201d; the farmers yelled back. &#x201c;Go get &#x2019;em.&#x201d;<br><br> Huey&#x2019;s crowd of farmers looked up at a man in his thirties, of medium height, approaching pudginess with a round face, puffy jowls, and skin glowing pink like a fresh sunburn. An unruly mop of chestnut-colored hair topped his head, with a curly forelock that tumbled down. An oversized nose jutted from his face and his brown eyes were large, round, and expressive, shifting from jest to rage in a twinkling. When he walked, he jostled along &#x201c;like a saddling pony.&#x201d; As Huey dazzled his audiences, at times he appeared almost childish, spoiled, and &#x201c;like an overgrown small boy with very bad habits indeed.&#x201d; In an instant, however, his face could turn exceedingly hard and cruel.<br><br> A dominating egotist, Huey hungered for the spotlight and could not bear to share it with another. &#x201c;The only kind of band in which Huey Long could play,&#x201d; one newspaper editor wrote, &#x201c;was a one-man band.&#x201d; A skillful speechmaker, he craved the microphone. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t remember back to a time when my mouth wasn&#x2019;t open whenever there was a chance to make a speech,&#x201d; he remarked. He could not stand to be ignored by the newspapers, admitting that &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care what they say about me as long as they say something.&#x201d; He knew that Louisiana voters would cast their votes for a known thief before they would vote for a name they did not recognize. Desperately wanting to be noticed, he dressed in a dazzling mix of pastel suits, purple shirts, flaming red flowered ties, and two-toned wing tips that provoked one onlooker to describe him as an explosion in a paint factory. &#x201c;Drama was his natural art,&#x201d; a supporter wistfully remembered, &#x201c;an actor whose stage was his work, whose scenery, the people about him.&#x201d;<br><br> Perpetually in motion, Huey wielded his &#x201c;energy of ten men&#x201d; as one of his most effective weapons. If he could not whip his political opponents with his brilliance or cunning, he simply wore them out by working harder, traveling more miles, making more speeches, shaking more hands, and twisting more arms. &#x201c;He never relaxed,&#x201d; observed a campaign worker. &#x201c;He got along with little or no sleep when he was under pressure. He awakened associates at all hours of the night to talk over a new notion which had come to him in bed.&#x201d; Always mesmerizing, he cast a spell upon his listeners. While he spoke at the parish fair that summer, a man who hated him stood to the side of the crowd, then disappeared. Later, one of Huey&#x2019;s supporters saw the man and asked why he left. &#x201c;I left because I was afraid. That guy was convincing me. I had to get out.&#x201d;<br><br> huey long was born on August 30, 1893, in Winn Parish, Louisiana, amid the red-clay hill country dotted with longleaf pine and where a dark and relentless poverty sapped the lives of the straitlaced Baptists who struggled to survive there. The people there were so poor that, according to a wry local joke, they made a living by taking in each other&#x2019;s wash. Many of them lived in clapboard cabins with dirt floors and subsisted off small worn-out farms, cut-over timber lands, and paltry cotton patches. The parish seat, Winnfield, languished as a mud-pathed village of about two thousand residents, with two hotels, a lumber mill, seven other buildings, and neither running water nor electricity. The town was notable only for &#x201c;large numbers of hogs and children, and by a scarcity of Negroes.&#x201d;<br><br> A year before Huey was born, his parents, Hugh and Caledonia Long, moved from Tunica, Mississippi, to Winnfield. Hugh bought 320 acres of scrub land, which he cultivated with cotton and corn and where he let his hogs run wild in the woods. After 1900, Winnfield became a railroad hub, with four lines passing through the town, and the site of a roundhouse and repair shops. The railroad built a depot on the Long farm and within ten years the town grew to about three thousand inhabitants. Hugh sold part of the farm in lots. On one side of his farm the business section rose and on the other side residences sprang up. Although far from wealthy, Hugh became one of largest landowners and livestock holders in Winnfield. He grew and raised most of what the family consumed, and when they needed cash, he sold a pig or cow. In 1907, he built a large home in Winnfield, with two stories, ten rooms, electric lights, indoor plumbing, high ceilings, and large columned verandas on three sides. Two big white oaks sat in the front yard and celery and asparagus sprouted in a bed at one end of the front porch.<br><br> Hugh Long turned forty when Huey was born in 1893. By then, Hugh&#x2019;s hair was an iron gray and his face brown and wrinkled like a walnut shell. A gangly six-footer, he glared at people through the same penetrating brown eyes that all nine of his children would possess. Hugh loved to talk in a booming voice and could be found sitting in front of Bernstein&#x2019;s store in Winnfield under an ancient chinaberry tree, amusing the townsfolk with his dry wit. Hugh was eccentric, gentle, even weak, had only an elementary education, and bragged of voting for the Socialist candidate for president, Eugene Debs.<br><br> Huey&#x2019;s mother, Caledonia, like his father, came from Pennsylvania Dutch stock. A slender, hazel-eyed, and raven-haired woman who weighed less than a hundred pounds, Caledonia was disciplined, self-educated, and had a photographic memory that Huey would inherit. She insisted her children read the Bible and attend the First Baptist Church of Winnfield. She had a preacher baptize Huey in a neighbor&#x2019;s fishpond but the boy rebelled against his Baptist upbringing. Caledonia, who refused to whip her children, tried to manage Huey, the most unruly and headstrong of her nine offspring, but her efforts proved futile. Even before he could walk he demanded that he control everything and everyone around him. Always inquisitive, as a toddler he wandered off and on one occasion crawled beneath a steam locomotive and delayed a train departing the Winnfield station. As a rebellious teenager he smoked, drank, chewed tobacco, and cussed like a field hand.<br><br> Caledonia passed on her charitable spirit to Huey. Known throughout the parish as a generous and compassionate woman, she frequently sent her son to deliver food and clothing to less fortunate families. From his parents, Huey inherited a belief that the wealth of the land should be shared and that &#x201c;none should be too poor and none too rich.&#x201d; Caledonia insisted that Huey and the other children read avidly. If one of the youngsters was reading, the mother would not assign the child chores. The clever Huey learned to always have a book in his hands, whether or not he read it. At an early age he memorized long passages from the Bible, pored over Shakespeare&#x2019;s Julius Caesar, Hamlet, and The Merchant of Venice, and once bet a friend $10 that he could recite Bunyan&#x2019;s Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress. He admired Dumas&#x2019;s The Count of Monte Cristo, where the lead character metes out harsh revenge to his enemies. John Clark Ridpath&#x2019;s History of the World also made a lasting mark upon young Huey. In future years while stumping around the state, he quoted Ridpath, who stressed the crucial role of powerful leaders in world affairs and deplored the social evil ingrained in concentrated wealth.<br><br> Huey was bright, outspoken, aggressively self-confident, and forever seeking the center of attention. &#x201c;If he couldn&#x2019;t pitch, he wouldn&#x2019;t play,&#x201d; a childhood friend remarked. With a hot temper that fit his rust-colored hair, Huey could rage quickly into a tantrum, his bright, darting eyes revealing his anger. He quarreled often with his brothers and sisters, who were all smart and competitive. Of the four Long brothers and five sisters, three of the boys became attorneys, the fourth, George, a dentist and later congressman, and the girls received degrees in education from Louisiana Normal College in Natchitoches, one becoming a professor.<br><br> While in high school, Huey learned to set type and wrote short items for two local newspapers, the Baptist Monthly Guardian and the Southern Sentinel. When he was a junior, he competed on his high school debate team that traveled to Louisiana State University for the state rally. While in Baton Rouge, Huey stayed at the home of T. H. Harris, the state superintendent of education. &#x201c;The boy was a perfect portrait of the man to follow,&#x201d; Harris later recalled. &#x201c;He came swaggering into the house, leaving the baggage for others to bring in, and introduced himself to Mrs. Harris. . . . He was always late for meals, left his clothes all over the bathroom floor, and had everybody in the house awake by five or six in the morning.&#x201d;<br><br> Huey received an early education in Louisiana&#x2019;s freewheeling politics. He grew up in a household where the family argued politics each night at their large and noisy dinner table. When he turned seven, his father ran as an independent Democrat and finished a distant third in a state Senate race and ten years later finished sixth in a race for Winnfield&#x2019;s five aldermen. As a boy, Huey often walked into Winnfield, where he listened to the parish&#x2019;s rabble-rousers standing on the courthouse steps and sounding off at a political system that disenfranchised the poor population. In 1908, fourteen-year-old Huey campaigned at a polling precinct for Theo Wilkinson, who lost the race for governor to the New Orleans machine candidate, J. Y. Sanders. From the start, politics surged through Huey&#x2019;s veins. &#x201c;All I remember is that the first time I knew anything about it, I was in it.&#x201d;<br><br> Huey never had much patience for school. In 1910, just before his seventeenth birthday, Winnfield High School expelled him. He was already showing an obsession to be in charge and to control those around him. &#x201c;We had formed a secret society. . . . We wore a red ribbon,&#x201d; he recalled later. He belonged to &#x201c;a sort of circle that was to run things, laying down certain rules the students would have to follow.&#x201d; If the students obeyed faculty rules, then Huey and his followers kept them off the baseball team or the debating team. The faculty told Huey that his antics were out of order but he continued to defy their authority. After he published a circular attacking the teachers, the principal expelled him. Even after being expelled, he did not give up. He hand-delivered a petition around Winnfield and convinced a majority of the citizens to sign it. They fired the principal.<br><br> Huey did not try to finish high school. He left Winnfield in July and took a job as a traveling salesman selling Cottolene, a lard substitute made from cottonseed oil. His salary was $19 a week. He traveled across the South, hawking his product and distributing pie plates and cookbooks and holding baking contests in cities and towns. Selling Cottolene door-to-door, Huey soon became a persistent and skillful salesman who combined his wit and outgoing personality with iron-willed determination to make a sale. He often turned to the Scriptures to persuade his customers. &#x201c;I used the Bible on them, showing where the Lord had forbidden the Israelites to use anything from the flesh of swine food, and how cottonseed oil, seeing it was a vegetable product, was just bound to be pure.&#x201d; When quoting the Scriptures failed to produce a sale, he was more aggressive. &#x201c;If I couldn&#x2019;t convince the woman no other way I&#x2019;d go right into the kitchen and bake a cake for her, or cook supper for the family,&#x201d; he recalled. &#x201c;I had to persuade those womenfolks that you could bake a cake with something else besides cow butter and fry meat in something else besides hog lard.&#x201d; Years later, many housewives remembered young Huey, his red curls tousled, barging into their farmhouse, rolling up his sleeves, and scattering flour about the steamy kitchen as he baked a cake or fried some chicken.<br><br> After only a few months, Huey was fired in November 1910 when business slumped. He next took a job in Memphis selling cured meats, lard, and canned goods for an Austin, Texas, food wholesaler. He met his quotas but ran through his expense account by staying in the most expensive hotels and eating lavishly and, &#x201c;after being given a few warnings, which I did not heed, I was summarily discharged.&#x201d; With no job and less than a dollar in his pocket, Huey was evicted from his Memphis hotel room. &#x201c;I went from park to depot and depot to railroad yards, sleeping wherever I might be permitted to lay my head.&#x201d;</p><h2>Bolt Action: Armies of Germany: 2nd Edition</h2><p>Revised and expanded for <i>Bolt Action 2nd Edition</i>, this book provides players with all of the information they need to command Germany's military might.

But the owner died, leaving his real-estate-rich, cash-poor relatives to turn the domicile into a commercial property.<br><br> By 1968 the first floor had become an antique-furniture shop where fifty-something Mrs. Ina Holloway sold old sofas, chairs, and dining tables of dubious pedigree to middle-aged women from Cheviot Hills&#x2014;women who wanted to make their interior decorations equal in style, if not in value, to their wealthier counterparts&#x2019; in nearby Beverly Hills.<br><br> The second floor was occupied by an insurance brokerage firm owned and run by Harry (born Hiro) Harada. To hear him tell it, Harry sold insurance on everything from life expectancy to pet health and marriage vows. Harry&#x2019;s wife and daughter, son, and daughter-in-law all worked in his second-floor office. Only Harada&#x2019;s gaijin son-in- law no longer worked for the old man; this because he had been in prison for a crime he confessed to, embezzlement. He, Arnold &#x201c;Sandy&#x201d; Patterson, was convicted on evidence that was not vetted by the defense or the prosecution&#x2014;evidence that would not have stood up under scrutiny.<br><br> The police detective who interrogated Sandy accepted his confession of having stolen money that Harry&#x2019;s strawberry-farmer client, Gentaro Takeda, had entrusted to the company: $131,247.29. The money Gentaro gave had been in cash, and the day that everyone agreed that Sandy had taken it he was under the knife at Cedars of Lebanon for an emergency appendectomy.<br><br> Indeed, it was Harry himself who had taken the money, believing that his client was senile and probably wouldn&#x2019;t remember anything about the transaction. So three days later, when the elderly Mr. Takeda returned with his son Ishi to ask for the money back, Harry felt that he was safe in saying he had never received the cash in question. Mr. Gentaro had once told him, Harry claimed, that he wanted to have Harry invest some money but he had never given him the cash.<br> After the Takedas left, Mitsue, Harry&#x2019;s daughter, told him that the day after Gentaro had been there he returned saying that he had not gotten a receipt from her father. Harry was at a convention in San Diego so she looked up the transaction in his day journal, saw that no receipt had been issued, and had filled out one of the pre-signed receipts that Harry kept in the safe just in case the family had to do business in his absence.<br><br> That right there was the moment of truth for Harry Harada. Gentaro didn&#x2019;t seem to remember any receipt and Ishi hadn&#x2019;t mentioned one. Harry&#x2019;s greed outweighed his morality; it convinced him that the dotty old man probably lost the voucher and that the money, all cash, could not be traced. He told his daughter to forget the receipt and the visit.<br><br> When Ishi pressed charges in Gentaro&#x2019;s name, Harry stuck to his story. But, three months later, when the receipt Mitsue provided resurfaced, a warrant was issued for Harry&#x2019;s arrest. He had testified under oath that he never received monies from Gentaro and had therefore broken the law.<br><br> Mitsue begged her husband to take the blame for the good of the family. Mitsue explained that even if the father was able to stay out of prison he&#x2019;d lose his license and his customers, impoverishing the entire clan.<br><br> And so stout-hearted Sandy confessed. There was no trial to speak of, so the elderly Gentaro, who was indeed senile and unreliable as a witness, was not required to appear in court. Sandy admitted telling Gentaro that he was Harry, and the confused old man believed him. Sandy explained about the pre-signed receipts in the safe, saying that he was trying to get enough money to start a business of his own.<br> &nbsp;<br><br>Four months after Sandy was locked away I came to the building looking for office space. Harry managed the property but his wife, Kikuyo, did all the work. The handsome middle-aged mother-in-law did not seem very interested in me as a tenant, probably because of my skin color (which is a very dark brown); that is until I told her that I was a private detective. Upon hearing this she asked me if I could help an innocent man get out of prison.<br> &nbsp;<br><br>It was a delicate operation. Gentaro Takeda&#x2019;s mental condition had declined further. By the time I became involved his testimony could no longer be trusted. When asked who he had given the money to he replied, &#x201c;My son.&#x201d;<br><br> The money had been returned and Kikuyo convinced Harry to give Ishi Takeda ten thousand dollars to forgo any further complaint. I went to the state&#x2019;s attorney with evidence that they had convicted and imprisoned an innocent man, and so Sandy was set free and thestate decided not to pursue further charges.<br><br> Kikuyo, without telling her husband, gave my company, WRENS-L Detective Agency, an unheard-of fifteen-year lease at a very reasonable rent.<br><br> Harry thought I was overcompensated but he said so only once because, in spite of his dishonesty, he was a family man and freeing Mitsue&#x2019;s husband brought bliss to his home and his business.<br> &nbsp;<br><br> So at 7:42 a.m. on the first Monday in May 1968, I stood out in front of the gaily colored plaster-encased building: a professional detective with a bright future and a dark past.<br><br>Ten months earlier I had received a questionable windfall of one hundred thousand dollars in ransom money that no one wanted to claim. I used part of the money to start my own little detective agency with the two best detectives I knew&#x2014;Saul Lynx and Tinsford &#x201c;Whisper&#x201d; Natly. Saul was a Jewish detective married to a black woman who had given him two sons. He was born and raised in L.A. and was accepted, more or less, in white circles. Whisper was a Negro from St. Louis who could find anyone, anywhere, given the time and resources.<br><br> Saul, Whisper, and I were equal partners in the business and they were repaying the initial investment at three hundred dollars a month, each.<br><br> I took in a deep breath through my nostrils and smiled, thinking that a poor black man from the deep South like myself was lucky not to be dead and buried, much less a living, breathing independent businessman.<br><br> Our little agency had a separate entrance that opened onto a stairwell made only for us. I took the steps two at a time until I reached the third-floor doorway. There I stopped again, happy that I wasn&#x2019;t dead and that soon, if the sky didn&#x2019;t fall that day, I&#x2019;d be engaged to the lovely Bonnie Shay.<br><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Good morning, Mr. Rawlins,&#x201d; Niska Redman greeted.<br><br> She was our receptionist. Butter-skinned, biracial, and quite beautiful&#x2014;Niska had worked for Whisper after he saved her father from false charges alleged by a business partner. She was twenty-four and filled with dreams of a world in which all humans were happy and well fed.<br> &#x201c;How you doin&#x2019;, Miss Redman?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Great!&#x201d; she exclaimed, showing wide eyes and lots of teeth. &#x201c;I started practicing Transcendental Meditation. You know, only twenty minutes every morning and night and you have peace of mind all day long.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s like prayer?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br> &#x201c;More like yoga or hypnosis,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;How are you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Down to one cigarette a day and I walked to work this morning.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Good for you.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Whisper in?&#x201d;<br><br> Her nod was vigorous and certain. &#x201c;Nobody with him,&#x201d; she added.<br> &nbsp;<br><br> His door was open but I knocked anyway.<br><br> &#x201c;Come in, Easy,&#x201d; he said in a low tone.<br><br> Whisper&#x2019;s face was medium brown with no marked features. You might overlook him even if he was standing right there in front of you. He wore short-brimmed hats of gray or brown without feathers or even a hatband. His clothes were not new or old, natty or disheveled. He only spoke in a low voice, not a whisper, and no one I knew had ever seen his apartment or house. There were some that believed he was married, and one woman I knew swore that she&#x2019;d seen him sitting in the last pew at Lion&#x2019;s Den New Baptist Church.<br><br> &#x201c;How&#x2019;s it goin&#x2019;, Tinsford?&#x201d; I asked, taking the straight-back pine visitor&#x2019;s chair set in front of his small, battered oak desk.<br><br> Instead of answering he looked at me with dark brown eyes that contained a question.<br><br> &#x201c;What?&#x201d; I replied to his unspoken inquiry.<br><br> &#x201c;Somethin&#x2019; up?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No. Why?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Somethin&#x2019; happy about you this morning.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How&#x2019;s that thing with, um, what&#x2019;s her name?&#x201d; I asked, avoiding his question out of nothing but pure stubbornness.<br><br> &#x201c;Lolo Bowles,&#x201d; Whisper said, &#x201c;Keisha Bowles&#x2019;s daughter.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You locate her yet?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not in the flesh but I got some leads. You know anybody run one of those clinics gets you off of drugs?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Saul&#x2019;s got a guy.&#x201d;<br><br> Whisper nodded and I stood up.<br><br> It was often the case that we asked each other questions, most of which went unanswered. We were all private sort of men who gathered information rather than distributed it.<br><br> Our corporation had been up and running for three months but it felt like years. I had never imagined that I&#x2019;d enjoy working with partners, but just that one cryptic interchange between me and Whisper felt something like belonging.<br><br> &nbsp;<br> My office was at the end of the hallway behind Niska&#x2019;s desk. It had been the master bedroom, making it the largest office with a nice view of a few green backyards. I would have preferred a smaller room but Saul and Whisper took those options before I finished signing the papers Kikuyo Harada had placed before me.<br><br> My five-hundred-square-foot office had dark oak floors and a huge cherrywood desk given me by Jean-Paul Villard, president and CEO of P9, one of the largest insurance companies in the world. JP liked me and was my good friend Jackson Blue&#x2019;s boss. When Villard heard that I was going into business for myself, rather than taking the managerial security job he&#x2019;d offered, he sent the desk over just to show me there were no hard feelings.<br><br> I sat down in my padded mechanical chair, leaned back, and took out the little black velvet ring box that held a brilliant-cut half-carat diamond, set in platinum and gold.<br><br> In the last year and a half I had been as close to death as a living being can get and climbed my way back up into a world that seemed new and hopeful. I had two great kids, a perfect island woman that I would soon propose to, a profession I was good at, friends that I liked, and access to powers that most people in Los Angeles (white or black) didn&#x2019;t even know existed.<br><br> I had built the kind of life that I wanted, and once Bonnie said yes, everything would be perfect.<br> The buzzer on my desk sounded.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; I said, pressing the button on the console.<br><br> &#x201c;Raymond Alexander for you, Mr. Rawlins,&#x201d; Niska said.<br><br> &#x201c;On the phone?&#x201d; I asked, maybe a little hopefully.<br><br> &#x201c;No, dude,&#x201d; Mouse called from the background.

Let&#39;s face it - for many people it is not a lack of education that leads them to polish off a packet of chocolate biscuits after dinner, but their biochemistry and emotions.
